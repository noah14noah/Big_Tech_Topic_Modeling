Vodafone will attest to that. Despite racking up a (EURO)19bn bill trying to go toe-to-toe with powerful industrialist Mukesh Ambani, the FTSE 100 operator has warned that its ill-fated Indian venture is staring bankruptcy in the face.</p><p>The reality is that it is impossible to compete with India's richest man, while the country's government, regulators, and courts, continue to act in his favour. Even Vodafone, one of the world's biggest telecoms providers, has practically been chased out of the country.</p><p>Still, there's another way, as Mark Zuckerberg has shown: if you can't beat 'em, join 'em.</p><p>Facebook has just taken a $5.7bn stake in Ambani's internet operation Jio Platforms, handing it a 10pc slice of the company.</p><p>It's a smart move. By offering unlimited data and calls for just a few dollars a month Jio has managed to become India's largest carrier, in a market offering almost unmatched potential.</p><p>Vodafone should have bowed out years ago but the promise of vast riches persuaded it to double down on more than one occasion. India has a population of 1.3bn, half of whom are under 25; smartphone penetration is just 35pc; and there is no chance of a fixed-line network ever being built to service the country's internet needs. Facebook is massive in India where more than 300m use its core social network.</p><p>WhatsApp offers even more potential; 400m people in the country use its global messaging app and it has become the go-to digital platform for many of India's small business owners.</p><p>The digital Shangri-La for both sides would be to pair the service with Jio's new online grocery venture, Jiomart, so that customers can buy goods via WhatsApp. Even a global health emergency can't slow the march of big tech.</p><p>1 City Intelligence Don't miss Ben Marlow's exclusive round-up of the biggest corporate stories of the week, every Friday.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/city-intelligence\">www.telegraph.co.uk/city-intelligence</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-159410804</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YRB-KKR1-JCBW-N4WG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"327\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 2, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC000949Q</classCode><className>VODAFONE D2 GMBH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS517312 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4812 RADIOTELEPHONE COMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Group adjusted EBITDA was up 4.2% at  14.74 billion.</p><p>The company also confirmed that, on Oct. 1, CFO Nick Read will assume the role of CEO, replacing Colao. Margherita Della Valle, who has been deputy CFO since 2015, will assume the role of CFO and become a member of the board.</p><p>Colao reflected on his time as CEO. He noted that the company, which recently agreed to acquire Liberty Global PLC's cable assets in four European countries and last year announced an Indian merger with Idea Cellular Ltd, has undergone a wave of M&amp;A transformations during his 10-year tenure, resulting investments totaling over  150 billion across CapEx, spectrum and acquisitions;

However, on the revenue front, the company reported flat growth on a year on year basis. On a sequential basis, revenue rose 6 per cent to Rs 11,754 crore due to tariff hike. The company's subscriber base declined to 291 million in fourth quarter from 304 million in the previous quarter while average revenue per user improved to Rs 121 from Rs 109 in the same period. The telecom company, which is estimated to have AGR-related dues of more than Rs 46,000 crore, said that its ability to continue as a going concern depends on the Supreme Court giving it a favourable verdict in the adjusted gross revenue (AGR) matter. It has sought 20 years to clear the dues and said its survival depends the court verdict and successful negotiations with lenders. Vodafone Idea breached debt covenants as on March end, limiting its ability to generate fresh funds to settle its dues.  At 10:07 AM, the stock was trading 2.35 per cent lower at Rs 10.37 as compared to 0.5 per cent gain in the S&amp;P BSE Sensex. A combined around 22.8 crore shares have already changed hands on the NSE and BSE so far.  What brokerages say  Analysts at Motilal Oswal have placed the stock 'under review' in their result update, saying that with an uncertain outlook, the stock may be highly volatile to media reports on regulatory/judicial outcomes.  \"VIL weak cash position with outstanding cash and equivalents of INR26.6b in FY20E and EBITDA (pre INDAS 116) of INR58.1b would be insufficient to service estimated cash requirement of ~INR135b in FY21/22 and much higher INR300b FY23 onwards (as the two year deferred spectrum payment moratorium ends). We believe ~50% price would be required to keep it afloat,\" the brokerage said.  It also said that Vodafone Idea was losing competitive position in the telecom sector and that the company's high leverage leaves limited upside for the shareholders.  \"A positive outcome (in AGR case) may provide a lease of life. It needs ~50% big price hike to generate potential EBITDA of INR250b to garner sustainable cash flows, sufficient to service the debt (bank as well as deferred spectrum) and capex. Yet, this may leave limited incremental opportunity for the equity holders, assuming 8x EV/EBITDA and INR1.1t net debt and additional INR510b AGR liability,\" the brokerage said.  Credit Suisse said that Vodafone Idea's net debt (including AGR dues) remains high at 18.8X while the company's long-term viability continues to remain under a cloud.  \"It continues to trail Bharti Airtel on growth and subscriber metrics. Net Debt (ex-AGR dues) rose 9% QOQ as cash balance rapidly depletes. The company may find it challenging to service AGR dues if payment tenure is short,\" it said.  On the other hand, analysts at CLSA reiterated their 'BUY' rating on the stock, while also lifting the target price from Rs 12 to Rs 14 due to the \"favourable risk-reward ratio\".  \"Voda Idea's Q4 revenue was ahead of our estimate. Mobile ARPU increased 11% QoQ to Rs 121 but subcribers declined to 291 million...VIdea's debt burden is enormous, at Rs 1.125 bn/$15 bn, but 78% is spectrum liabilities. With a rise in Ebitda, gearing will fall to c.6x by FY22CL. We raise our FY21-22CL forecast by c.1% and see further upside, with potential sector floor tariffs.,\" it said.  Speaking on Vodafone Idea's quarterly results, associate equity analyst at Angel Broking, Keshav Lahoti, said that overall, the result was better than street estimates in terms of revenue, ARPU, EBIDTA and EBIDTA margins.  \"However, among all the three leading telecom operators, only Vodafone Idea lost subscribers. Favourable Supreme Court ruling, improvement in ARPU, reduction in loss of market share and any major investment by a big tech investor will be the key triggers for upside in the stock,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-42490964863</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6083-0481-JCSC-J553-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"722\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Business Standard India</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>India</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Asia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Southern Asia</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Employees &amp;

Only now there\u2019s a new step in banking\u2019s digital evolution: voice assistants.   One fan of the new vocal revolution is Depika Koria, the Product Owner for Voice Assistants in HSBC\u2019s Global Innovation and Partnerships team. She is responsible for leading on voice discovery and ideation, piloting concepts and shaping the voice roadmap for retail banking.  Depika has worked across the Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri platforms primarily in the UK and US.    Prior to HSBC, she developed Mobile Product strategy at Visa Europe and has previously held Product and Innovation roles at Barclays and Barclaycard International.  Passionate about human-centric technology, here Depika explains why she is striving to make banking more human in this age of machines.   Depika Koria is the Global Product Owner for Voice Assistants at HSBC   Voice assistants are usually standalone smart speakers, home devices, or voice capability built into smart phones, allowing users to speak to a computer to perform a task, rather than touching, typing or swiping on a keyboard or screen. Banks are able to build voice applications on these platforms.   As of 2019, there were an estimated 3.25 billion digital voice assistants being used in devices across the world.  These are brought to consumers by the global \u2018big tech\u2019 brands and there are already a wide range of uses.  You can ask them to make a call for you, play music, or check train times.   Using them is simple, intuitive and about three times quicker than typing a request.  As the technology advances, many people are becoming comfortable with the idea of using them for shopping and, increasingly, banking.  Around 44% of voice assistant users in fact say they are interested in using them for this purpose, according to analysis by Capgemini.   Over the next few years it will become common for people to use digital assistants to make payments, organise their finances, and even seek advice on how to save money, as HSBC predicted in its recent Banking of the Future report.   Apart from being a more natural way to interact, voice assistants could make it easier for users to multi-task and bank hands-free.   Imagine you\u2019re at home after a busy day at work, preparing dinner and knowing, in the back of your mind, that you need to make a payment which will soon be overdue.  Rather than having to wait for a quiet moment, you could simply ask the voice assistant to complete the task for you there and then.   To those who are working from home and fed up with staring at a screen all day \u2013 as many are during the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 voice banking may seem an attractive option.   As well as providing greater convenience, voice assistants can also help broaden access to banking services. People with visual impairments or with arthritis, for example, sometimes find it difficult to use screen-based devices. Voice interactions are therefore a simple and more inclusive alternative way for them to manage their money.   It\u2019s important to acknowledge that some will have concerns about the security of voice technology. The onus is therefore on banks to demonstrate clearly that they have strong controls in place when building voice banking apps. Regulators, as well as consumers, will want reassurance that people\u2019s money will be safe and their personal data kept private.   Different people will also approach voice banking in different ways. Some customers may take time to get comfortable and only want basic, read-only functionality \u2013 like checking their balance.  Later, as they build confidence, they may be interested in more transactional functionality such as making payments.   Other customers may want to jump straight into advanced features \u2013 like asking their bank, through a voice assistant, to proactively provide recommendations on saving money.   To draw a parallel, it wasn\u2019t long ago that consumers had concerns about the idea of banking on their smartphone.  It was the same with contactless payments \u2013 but most of us today couldn\u2019t imagine a world without these services.   It is therefore vital for banks to put customers in control. This means allowing them to opt-in or out of voice banking \u2013 so they can tailor it to their particular needs, or choose not to use it at all.   Above all, explaining and demonstrating the benefits is key.  As with any new technology, users will want to understand what is in it for them. If they see that voice banking could make their life easier, and help them to save money, they are likely to give it a go.   Some analysts believe that we could see a large-scale switch to voice sooner than later.  Forecasts suggest that by 2023 the number of digital voice assistants will reach around eight billion units \u2013 a number higher than the world\u2019s population.   In each market, the catalyst for this growth is the adoption of smart speakers.  The United States originally had the lead, with the UK following closely, however adoption is now picking up in the Asia Pacific region.  In the last year, it was China\u2019s big tech players that saw the most growth.  China\u2019s adoption rate currently tops all countries.   Whatever the rate of take-up, voice technology has the potential to make customers\u2019 lives easier. I\u2019m confident that in the future many of us will be using it for banking: whether at home, using headphones on a run, or even \u2013 who knows \u2013 riding in a driverless car.

Why did Twitter suspend the accounts of the producers of the movie \"Unplanned\" on opening night? This isn't even the tip of the iceberg of the dirty tricks used against anyone that disagrees with their far-left agenda. Maybe the real idiots are the Daily News editorial writers; either for being too stupid to realize how stupid they are or for thinking that most readers are bigger idiots than them. </p><p> Joseph Matarazzo</p><p>That's FUCT</p><p>Brooklyn: Even when the Supreme Court gets it right, they get it wrong. In the free speech case for shirt company \"FUCT\", they, once again, found the government to be bold criminals violating the Bill of Rights (shocker). But, even the liberal judges said they would've sided against free speech if the over-broad statute had \"only\" banned \"vulgar/lewd\" trademarked speech! The court asked how we'd feel seeing racial epithets on clothing or in public? Gee, I don't know. Take a look at some 1970's Richard Pryor sets on YouTube. We all learned swear words, etc., from mommy and daddy, so I'd call it family values, wouldn't you? Puritanism is dying. We yearn for freedom. </p><p> Uchena Shorey</p><p>Time to 'Free Willy!'</p><p>Malverne, L.I.: Re: \"Killer whales share behavior traits with primates, including humans\" (June 24): Whales and dolphins don't need to be held captive for us to understand that they are highly intelligent, emotionally complex, sociable and communicative. Scientists who observe cetaceans have known that for decades. Instead, SeaWorld and its former Spanish partner, Loro Parque, who were behind the study, use the findings to justify confining these remarkable animals in barren tanks and denying them their natural needs. They should be released to seaside sanctuaries where they can thrive. </p><p> John Di Leonardo</p><p>Sides of the same coin</p><p>Cranbury, N.J.: I don't understand people like Voicer Ralph Valente.

We have a mirror image with the herd of Democrats running for president in the 2020 election. These candidates want to feed their egos and gain name recognition for future local elections. Twenty-three of 24 Democratic candidates are unqualified to be president, and one of them could end up running against the current unqualified Republican contender for president in 2020. As an Independent, I vote for the candidate who is most qualified for the position. If the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates are not qualified, then I will vote for myself.</p><p> Donald Moskowitz</p><p>Corporal punishment</p><p>Long Island City: It is my contention that every woman who was forced to have Harvey Weinstein between their legs would love to chop off Harvey's ding dong.

There are a lot of Leona Helmsleys around, few male equivalents.  Georgia Makiver</p><p>Skewed journalism</p><p>Long Island City: I find your whole coverage of the Queens DA primary results disingenuous. Tiffany Cab\u00e1n has not defeated or toppled the Queens Democratic Party. Look at the numbers: Cab\u00e1n - 39.57%; Katz - 38.3% ; Lasak - 14.5%. The reality is that Lasak pulled from Katz. Without Lasak in the race, Katz would have easily received over 52% of the vote. But I guess the truth isn't sexy enough to be reported.

Jeff Van Drew. Unlike Van Drew, whose pre-political career was as a dentist, Richter comes with a record of job producing achievement. Where I previously lived prior to moving to Cape May County in 1990, I had observed the Richter family start up a business in their home that eventually over the years mushroomed into a massive job producing machine, something Cape May County desperately needs in the coming years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I was especially impressed that a late friend of mine, a New Jersey Democratic senator, Tom Foy, who for years represented two of the biggest unions, appreciated Hill Inc. so much and the Richter family business for its ability to generate jobs that he joined them to further their success.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> David Richter is what both Cape May and New Jersey need at this crucial time for the economy and culture.</p><p> Tony De Angelis</p><p> Villas</p><p> Trout the rare sports star who deserves admiration</p><p> Sometimes you read things and simply shake your head in disbelief. Such as the recent letter writer who opined that The Press sports section should cease publishing a daily update on Millville's Mike Trout.</p><p> Trout is indisputably the best player in baseball. He is arguably the single greatest player in any sport today. He will go down in history as one of the best players ever to play the game ... perhaps the greatest.</p><p> He is an exemplary role model who has never said or done anything to provoke an ounce of controversy. And he's one of our own, a local boy who has risen to heights seldom achieved by anyone in any sport.</p><p> I guarantee you there are thousands like me who turn to the Trout update first thing when I open the paper each morning.</p><p> Rodger Gottlieb</p><p> Galloway Township</p><p> Reduce gulls with a hunt</p><p> There may be unintended consequences for Ocean City's recent decision to hire falconers to discourage its population of gulls.</p><p> I lived in Ocean City for many years and have experienced the issue first hand. However, I think the city's decision to hire falconers to deter seagulls is short-sighted. I have studied ecology and food-web dynamics for many years in higher education and see a possible problem with the city's solution to the gulls.</p><p> The gull population has surely grown over the years because of the abundance of easy carbs and sugar (from feeding on the boardwalk). The population requires this level of food to survive the winter. Now that the falconers are deterring the seagull population from feeding on the boardwalk, they will be starting the winter with less food than they are accustomed to. This could lead to some gulls starving or even a mass starvation. This in turn could lead to disease and might boost the population of creatures that eat dead seagulls.</p><p> The cost of these falconers is also a reason why this may be a bad idea. It would be more effective if the city got permission from the state wildlife authorities to allow hunters to cull the seagull population over the winter with controlled, regulated hunts with a lottery system that would take place on the beach. This would gradually decrease the gull population and bring revenue from fees to the city.</p><p> Henry Raab</p><p> Ocean City</p><p> Clean energy also pollutes</p><p> Regarding the recent commentary by Adam Minter, \"Big Tech needs to save deep seas from destructive mining\":</p><p> I recommend reading this column. It points out that big tech companies pushing \"green energy\" seldom tell you about the unintended consequences.</p><p> A perfect example is the neodymium extraction operation in Baotou, China. Neodymium is used to make the high tech magnets in wind turbines and electric car motors. The extraction process uses massive amounts of fossil fuel (coal) releasing tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.</p><p> Another byproduct of this is a pit of radioactive toxic waste 2 square miles on what was once fertile farmland. The construction of wind turbines also consumes large amounts of fossil fuels in the production of concrete, steel and the carbon fiber blades. Then there is the heavy equipment used to erect the turbines, including large ships and barges if being placed offshore.</p><p> In Minter's article he points out that companies that make batteries for electric vehicles and for electric storage are running out of land-based minerals. Their plan is to scour the bottom of the ocean for mineral-containing rocks. It just so happens that these rocks are part of the ecosystem and no one knows the long-term effects that this type of mining would have on the oceans.</p><p> Any source of energy is going to create pollution one way or another. We just have to make sure that not more damage is being done in the pursuit of what is touted as non-polluting energy.</p><p> Gerald Raab</p><p> Ocean City</p><p> Legislation helps veterans</p><p> As a retired Army sergeant and corrections captain, I have seen firsthand the challenges that veterans face after returning home.</p><p> I graduated high school in Millville in 1968, which was a big year in the Vietnam War. I ended up in I Corps, not far from the demilitarized zone. I was 20 at the time and it was a heck of a way to grow up. At times it seems like a million years ago. Other times it feels like yesterday. But it made me who I am.</p><p> Once I got back home, I was lucky enough to meet and marry my wife, Bonnie. I was blessed to have a career in law enforcement, retiring as a captain several years ago. And I was fortunate to be able to be involved in the community, coaching youth basketball, baseball and soccer for 13 years while my kids were in school; and being an active community member in everything from the North Italy Club and the Thunderbolt Club to the American Legion and the Elks. For a lot of years most people called me coach, not assemblyman.</p><p> But most of us who have served in the military want to continue our service. We take an oath, and that oath never ends. So in 2015, at the ripe young age of 64, I ran for the Assembly.</p><p> It's been rewarding to make such a difference in people's lives as an assemblyman. Together with Bob Andrzejczak and Matt Milam, I've been able to pass 25 bills to help veterans, including laws to provide job training and scholarships to returning veterans.</p><p> This year we passed legislation to double the veterans income tax deduction to $6,000. This, coupled with legislation to expand the senior property tax freeze, will help veterans and seniors who are on a fixed income stay in their homes and retire with a bit of dignity.</p><p> It is important that qualified residents know about these programs and take full advantage of them, and we invite them to contact our offices to apply. They can call (609) 465-0700 in Cape May County and (856) 696-7109 in Cumberland County.</p><p> Assemblyman Bruce Land</p><p>Cape May Court House</p><p> Levitts created wildlife park</p><p> Most of us are familiar with the phrase \"giving back to the community.\" This phrase is an especially fitting way to describe the efforts of a couple in Northfield that have given back to the community in a big way.</p><p> Following a fire in 2018 that destroyed the home next door to theirs on Bay Avenue, Richard and Debbie Levitt purchased the vacant property with the idea of turning it into a backyard wildlife habitat for all to enjoy. The Levitts, who have been active residents in the Northfield community for over 40 years, did just that by converting the lot into a picturesque park, featuring unobstructed views of the surrounding marshes, rare wildlife ranging from terrapins to ospreys and seasonal wildflowers. Whether it's bird watching, a peaceful walk along a quarter acre path or just a seat on the park bench that the Levitts have graciously provided, this unique space has something for everyone.</p><p> Over the course of the nearly two decades I've spent in public service, I've come across great people from all walks of life in Atlantic County, but it always inspires me to see that the human spirit of giving is still alive and well. As a lifelong resident of Northfield, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Richard and Debbie Levitt for their incredibly thoughtful gesture that offers something for both residents and visitors to enjoy for many years to come.</p><p> Assemblyman Vince Mazzeo</p><p> Northfield</p><p> Don't cooperate with ICE</p><p> I think the closing words in the Pledge of Allegiance, \"with liberty and justice for all,\" has been rendered meaningless by the Cape May County freeholders. This is the result of Sheriff Nolan's renewal of the cooperative 287(g) agreement with ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement). This program came into existence as far back as 1997 but under President Trump I think it now provokes widespread terror and fear. Protect and serving by keeping criminals off the street, regardless of immigration status. The agreement drains resources and allows prison guards to assist in law enforcement.</p><p> Sheriff Nolan and Freeholder Chairman Gerald Thornton say that only criminals in the Cape May County jail will be processed under the ICE agreement. This could begin what might become the process of deportation. I think being in the country illegally should be a civil offence, not a criminal one. Many undocumented and naturalized citizens in the country are supporting the tourist industry and agriculture by working for wages few Americans would accept.</p><p> Whether Thornton and Nolan are sincere in their assurances that this ICE arrangement won't expand at the county jail, no one should be lulled into complacency with their words\"</p><p> Steven Fenichel</p><p> Ocean City</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRSATC-PAC0030310681</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0EABABB8B3650A25 PRSATC2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X1D-SMG1-JBCN-4495-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">315725</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1587\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Press of Atlantic City All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Press of Atlantic City</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>11 September 2019</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TCX</classCode><className>US DEMOCRATIC PARTY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X8V</classCode><className>MENTORS &amp; ROLE MODELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009SR8</classCode><className>FAMILY COMPANIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000980</classCode><className>JOB CREATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000608</classCode><className>EMPLOYMENT GROWTH</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX000170</classCode><className>BASEBALL</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000D1EZ</classCode><className>STARVATION</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>STX001624</classCode><className>STARTUPS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N611310SS</classCode><className>COLLEGES &amp; UNIVERSITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N611310SS</classCode><className>COLLEGES &amp; UNIVERSITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>PE000DNBY</classCode><className>JEFF VAN DREW</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS146</classCode><className>NEW JERSEY, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Edited excerpts:</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Google Executive Chairman Eric Schmidt </nameText></person>has a big role - some say, the biggest role - in getting the company to $50 billion in revenue. Schmidt joined Googlein 2001 as CEO. Over the next decade, he made the right bets as the Internet grew, attracted top talent and took Googlepublic. In 2011, he made way for Larry Page as CEO. On a recent trip to India, his first since he joined the company, Schmidt spoke with Business Today on the India business, the evolution of local language search, and the Steve Jobs he knew. Edited excerpts:</p><p><br/>Q. Was there a moment or two in the last 10-11 years when you thought search could change the world in a way you never thought before?<br/>A. I don't think I understood how powerful information was until I began to see the use of Googlein popular media. YouTube was a partner in the 2008 elections with CNN, and I went to this debate. I was really surprised by the arrival of technology in mainstream. Today, we take it for granted Google's aspiration is to be your assistant, to know what you don't know and to get that information to you in whatever way is quickest, whatever technology will allow, and I think it is very powerful.<br/>Q. Some industries think Google's intention is to be the master<br/>A. Googleis careful to define its mission as a ranker-organiser and not as a judge. We don't want to restrict information. We want to give you more choices and then you choose.<br/>Q. Considering India is probably the third-largest Internet user base, will be second in twothree years<br/>A. It's going to be amazing. Just do the math.<br/>Q. The fact that there are so many languages act as a barrier or challenge, and then there is literacy<br/>A. Literacy is very easily solved by mobile phones. Give phones to someone and they will learn to read, because you have all the software on it... And the language issues, our machine translation technology is getting so good that it should be possible to do 100 per cent high-quality language transfer from all 26 languages, not now, but over time. I understand the language thing is very, very real. There is no unified language here in India. I also understand that not everyone speaks English The translation technology is at a point where you speak in one language, and the translation comes out in some other language. It is just getting better.<br/>Q. Do you see voice as an enabler?<br/>A. We would argue that Google's voice analysis software is the best in the world, better than (Apple's) Siri and so forth. GoogleGlass is controlled by voice, you talk to it, (and) it is able to recognise it. Voice and image recognition will be more important for languages that do not have very good keyboard solutions. So Googleand some other companies are working on image recognition on dialects and some of these solutions.<br/>Q. Do you see in two-three years, a non-English speaking Indian speaking to a Google phone?<br/>A. Sure. And again I am assuming the language will be in the majority order. It will start with Hindi, and then move down the stack, and the 26th language will be the last.<br/>Q. What does that mean for the business model of Googleor any other search company if the market expands to that extent?<br/>A. Our model is that we benefit with more users and more broadband. So narrowband users do not use Googleas much as broadband (users). Broadband users click on the ads more, they consume more and the model works better. In India, there are a lot of issues - e-commerce, distribution - but all those problems are going to get solved. Our revenue is growing quite well. I won't say the number, but it is one of the highest growing countries right now. So we know that the revenue potential in India is great, and we are investing heavily here. So don't feel sorry for us, we are doing just fine. We will find ways to monetise a large audience. If you have a billion Indians, you can make money.<br/>Q. How is social media changing search? If Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest are not in Googlesearch, how will it affect Google?<br/>A. There is no monopoly on this kind of information. I think Facebook is going to do fine, Twitter is going to do fine, Pintrest is going to do fine. It is good to have competition. GooglePlus is big enough. We get all the social signals we need. We do not need all the social signals; you just need to have some. GooglePlus is clearly big enough to be a viable competitor to Facebook.<br/>Q. You sat on the Apple board for some years. What was so distinct about it?<br/>A. There was no better product visionary in the world than Steve Jobs, in the choice of the unification of user experience, power, colour, style I think his impact on society and the world will be historical. There are people you meet in life who are bigger and better than anyone else, and in Steve's case it was because of his unique ability to build and run things and understand the technology and also add the design component that was unconventional. And today when you look at the product you see Steve, you look at the storage you see Steve, you look at the brand you see Steve. That was his genius - certainly not a perfect man, but a great one.<br/>Q. From an advertisement point of view broadcast is the big market to crack. When do you see the market being disrupted the way other legacy media was in the past?<br/>A. Television has withstood many critics of it, and it is regulated, but it is highly popular with very high market share. I think you will see more and more multi-modal things, more and more stuff done on YouTube and then brought to TV, and vice-versa. And then there will be an economic disruption just because of pricing, because prices are high, but I think television will be there for long.<br/>Q. When you meet the big content generators, what is it that you tell them?<br/>A. I think the obnoxious way to answer that question is say, \"You need some engineers to build the platforms\". It won't happen from marketing plans, and lawyers and legal plans, lawsuits and so forth, which have become a problem. The smartest people are building new kind of platforms with partners, offering editing, and so forth and they are just dealing with the reality. They are trying to figure out new markets and they are trying to monetise them... The fact of the matter is there are tablets that you can charge on - people will be consuming information on tablets You should figure out a way to work with us and our competitors to understand how to put the information. It is your future, because your customers are moving to this new platform.<br/>Q. Every big tech company is making the \"next big bet.\" What is Google's bet on?<br/>A. Our bet is on innovation. We will innovate at the same pace, if not faster. The market is big enough for everyone.<br/>Q. What will be your epitaph?<br/>A. He used Googleto beat death and he failed.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LIVMIL-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTOD2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58K2-FSF1-DYX3-50MJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">163808</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1124\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Living Media India Ltd.

Schmidt joined Googlein 2001 as CEO. Over the next decade, he made the right bets as the Internet grew, attracted top talent and took Googlepublic. In 2011, he made way for Larry Page as CEO. On a recent trip to India, his first since he joined the company, Schmidt spoke with Business Today on the India business, the evolution of local language search, and the Steve Jobs he knew. Edited excerpts:</p><p><br/>Q. Was there a moment or two in the last 10-11 years when you thought search could change the world in a way you never thought before?<br/>A. I don't think I understood how powerful information was until I began to see the use of Googlein popular media. YouTube was a partner in the 2008 elections with CNN, and I went to this debate. I was really surprised by the arrival of technology in mainstream. Today, we take it for granted Google's aspiration is to be your assistant, to know what you don't know and to get that information to you in whatever way is quickest, whatever technology will allow, and I think it is very powerful.<br/>Q. Some industries think Google's intention is to be the master<br/>A. Googleis careful to define its mission as a ranker-organiser and not as a judge. We don't want to restrict information. We want to give you more choices and then you choose.<br/>Q. Considering India is probably the third-largest Internet user base, will be second in twothree years<br/>A. It's going to be amazing. Just do the math.<br/>Q. The fact that there are so many languages act as a barrier or challenge, and then there is literacy<br/>A. Literacy is very easily solved by mobile phones. Give phones to someone and they will learn to read, because you have all the software on it... And the language issues, our machine translation technology is getting so good that it should be possible to do 100 per cent high-quality language transfer from all 26 languages, not now, but over time. I understand the language thing is very, very real. There is no unified language here in India. I also understand that not everyone speaks English The translation technology is at a point where you speak in one language, and the translation comes out in some other language. It is just getting better.<br/>Q. Do you see voice as an enabler?<br/>A. We would argue that Google's voice analysis software is the best in the world, better than (Apple's) Siri and so forth. GoogleGlass is controlled by voice, you talk to it, (and) it is able to recognise it. Voice and image recognition will be more important for languages that do not have very good keyboard solutions. So Googleand some other companies are working on image recognition on dialects and some of these solutions.<br/>Q. Do you see in two-three years, a non-English speaking Indian speaking to a Google phone?<br/>A. Sure. And again I am assuming the language will be in the majority order. It will start with Hindi, and then move down the stack, and the 26th language will be the last.<br/>Q. What does that mean for the business model of Googleor any other search company if the market expands to that extent?<br/>A. Our model is that we benefit with more users and more broadband. So narrowband users do not use Googleas much as broadband (users). Broadband users click on the ads more, they consume more and the model works better. In India, there are a lot of issues - e-commerce, distribution - but all those problems are going to get solved. Our revenue is growing quite well. I won't say the number, but it is one of the highest growing countries right now. So we know that the revenue potential in India is great, and we are investing heavily here. So don't feel sorry for us, we are doing just fine. We will find ways to monetise a large audience. If you have a billion Indians, you can make money.<br/>Q. How is social media changing search? If Facebook, Twitter, Pintrest are not in Googlesearch, how will it affect Google?<br/>A. There is no monopoly on this kind of information. I think Facebook is going to do fine, Twitter is going to do fine, Pintrest is going to do fine. It is good to have competition. GooglePlus is big enough. We get all the social signals we need. We do not need all the social signals; you just need to have some. GooglePlus is clearly big enough to be a viable competitor to Facebook.<br/>Q. You sat on the Apple board for some years. What was so distinct about it?<br/>A. There was no better product visionary in the world than Steve Jobs, in the choice of the unification of user experience, power, colour, style I think his impact on society and the world will be historical. There are people you meet in life who are bigger and better than anyone else, and in Steve's case it was because of his unique ability to build and run things and understand the technology and also add the design component that was unconventional. And today when you look at the product you see Steve, you look at the storage you see Steve, you look at the brand you see Steve. That was his genius - certainly not a perfect man, but a great one.<br/>Q. From an advertisement point of view broadcast is the big market to crack. When do you see the market being disrupted the way other legacy media was in the past?<br/>A. Television has withstood many critics of it, and it is regulated, but it is highly popular with very high market share. I think you will see more and more multi-modal things, more and more stuff done on YouTube and then brought to TV, and vice-versa. And then there will be an economic disruption just because of pricing, because prices are high, but I think television will be there for long.<br/>Q. When you meet the big content generators, what is it that you tell them?<br/>A. I think the obnoxious way to answer that question is say, \"You need some engineers to build the platforms\". It won't happen from marketing plans, and lawyers and legal plans, lawsuits and so forth, which have become a problem. The smartest people are building new kind of platforms with partners, offering editing, and so forth and they are just dealing with the reality.

The fact of the matter is there are tablets that you can charge on - people will be consuming information on tablets You should figure out a way to work with us and our competitors to understand how to put the information. It is your future, because your customers are moving to this new platform.<br/>Q. Every big tech company is making the \"next big bet.\" What is Google's bet on?<br/>A. Our bet is on innovation. We will innovate at the same pace, if not faster. The market is big enough for everyone.<br/>Q. What will be your epitaph?<br/>A.

Arguing that Silicon Valley is stifling their speech and suppressing right-wing content, publishers and provocateurs on the right are eyeing a public-relations battle against online giants like Google and Facebook, the same platforms they once relied on to build a national movement. In a sign of escalation, Peter Schweizer, a right-wing journalist known for his investigations into Hillary Clinton, plans to release a new film focusing on technology companies and their role in filtering the news. Tentatively titled \"The Creepy Line,\" Schweizer's documentary is expected to have its first screening in May in Cannes, France - during the Cannes Film Festival, but not as part of the official competition. </p><p>He used the same rollout two years ago for his previous film, an adaptation of his book \"Clinton Cash\" that he produced with Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News. \"The Creepy Line\" alludes to an infamous 2010 speech by Eric Schmidt, the chief executive of Google at the time, who dismissed concerns about privacy by declaring that his company's policy was \"to get right up to the creepy line and not cross it.\" The documentary, which has not been previously reported, dovetails with concerns raised in recent weeks by right-wing groups about censorship on digital media - a new front in a rapidly evolving culture war. If the mainstream media is a perennial enemy of the right, Big Tech is a fresh and novel foe, arguably more relevant to 2018. Facebook, Google and their ilk are facing tough questions about their inability to police the content they distribute, including Russian propaganda during the 2016 presidential campaign. The companies have also been accused by lawmakers, critics and activists of monopolistic tendencies and manipulative product design. The critique from conservatives, in contrast, casts the big tech companies as censorious and oppressive, all too eager to stifle right-wing content in an effort to mollify liberal critics. \"This could end up being the free speech issue of our time,\" said Alex Marlow, editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, which has published articles accusing Google and Facebook of, among other sins, political bias. \"The Silicon Valley elites are saying: 'We don't care what you want to see - we know what you should see. We know better.'\" Big Tech is easily associated with West Coast liberalism and Democratic politics, making it a fertile target for the right. And operational opacity at Facebook, Google and Twitter, which are reluctant to reveal details about their algorithms and internal policies, can leave them vulnerable, too. \"It's the perfect foil,\" said Eli Pariser, a former executive director of the liberal activist group MoveOn.org and the author of \"The Filter Bubble,\" a book about how consumers find information online. \"There's not even a real basis to establish objective research about what's happening on Facebook, because it's closed.\" Google, Facebook and Twitter loomed large at last month's Conservative Political Action Conference in Oxon Hill, Md., where dozens of guests squeezed into a standing-room-only ballroom for a discussion called \"Suppression of Conservative Views on Social Media: A First Amendment Issue.\" Among the panelists were James O'Keefe, the guerrilla filmmaker who has tried to undermine news outlets like the New York Times, the Washington Post and CNN, and James Damore, an engineer fired by Google after he circulated a memo arguing that biological differences accounted for the low number of women in engineering. Damore - a new celebrity in the right-wing world, who, in an interview, said of his first foray to CPAC, \"There's definitely a lot of people that want to take selfies\" - described a culture of dogmatic liberalism at Google. \"There are political activists in all of these companies that want to actively push a liberal agenda,\" he said. \"Why does it matter? Because these companies are so ubiquitous and powerful that they are controlling all the means of mass communication.\" In some ways, the complaints from the right about Big Tech mirror the grumblings of legacy news organizations, which have expressed concern that online algorithms wield too much power over how readers gain access to their content. Jeffrey Zucker, the president of CNN, derided Google and Facebook as \"monopolies\" and called for regulators to step in during a speech in Spain last month, saying the tech hegemony is \"the biggest issue facing the growth of journalism in the years ahead.\" And former President Barack Obama said at an off-the-record conference at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology last month that he worried Americans were living in \"entirely different realities\" and that large tech companies like Facebook were \"not just an invisible platform, they're shaping our culture in powerful ways.\" The contents of the speech were published by Reason magazine. In the right's more internet-savvy quarters, tech platforms have been a regular - and fruitful - subject of discussion since before the 2016 election. In May that year, Facebook was forced to respond to claims that the curators of its Trending Topics feature had suppressed conservative news sources, a controversy that called attention to Facebook's editorial power. That charge of editorial bias was echoed recently by Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist behind Infowars, who accused YouTube of planning to delete his organization's account, a claim that was widely shared among conservatives. YouTube did delete some videos that accused teenage survivors of the Parkland, Florida, school shooting of being \"crisis actors,\" and it issued \"strikes,\" or warnings, to the accounts of Infowars and Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and Infowars contributor. (YouTube denied that it had plans to delete the Infowars account.) Still, the brewing backlash did not stop Google and Facebook from courting the very crowd that now seems ready to declare them enemies. Both companies were sponsors at this year's CPAC, leading to a few awkward moments. Marlow, the editor of Breitbart, was asked in an interview what he thought about Google's giving a party in the midst of a crowd that is gunning for it. \"The least they can do,\" Marlow said, \"is buy us a drink.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN54420134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RVR-7TF1-DYRV-40K1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1054\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

Tech titan patent activity reflects this, including new Amazon patent filings describing how a \u201cvoice sniffer algorithm\u201d could be used on a variety of different devices to analyze audio in near-real time when it hears words like \u201clove,\u201d \u201cbought,\u201d or \u201cdislike.\u201d Google has patent applications describing how audio and visual signals can be used in a smart home context. This may seem harmless and even helpful in simplifying everyday tasks, but it also has serious implications for access to and use of personal data.</p><p>According to a 2018 PwC report, of the 25% of Americans who have no plans to shop with their voice in the future, more than 90% said lack of trust was a factor. These statistics find support and reinforcement in widely publicized examples of ways the technology has been used contrary to personal expectations. For example, a story of the recording of a private conversation between spouses that was sent to the husband\u2019s employee was covered in national news outlets. While most experts predict a positive growth trajectory for virtual assistants, this trust gap will likely hinder truly universal adoption.</p><p>Three foundational issues sit at the heart of the issue of trustworthiness and voice tech and will need to be addressed: data protection and transparency, privacy, and fraud.Data Protection and Transparency</p><p>There is a significant body of data associated with the development and use of voice technology. While the words spoken by a person to the interface may be the most obvious type of information being collected, analyzed, and (possibly) stored, there are several other categories that should be considered, including background noise captured, metadata, biometric data and voice prints, derivative data (for example, emotional information that can be determined based on the tone and pitch of the voice), not to mention the body of data collected to develop and train the voice algorithm.</p><p>The key principles of data protection have been long-recognized and are embodied in the Fair Information Practices. Legal frameworks around the world, such as the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), have codified and expanded upon these principles, often with severe penalties for non-compliance. Some jurisdictions, including the U.SState of Illinois, have even pursued laws specifically covering biometric information, such as voiceprints. These frameworks provide a baseline level of protection for people who interact with voice-driven tools, though it is often not enough.</p><p>To compliment these legal requirements, professionals in the field of privacy engineering have been developing practical approaches to incorporating data protection into tools and services. Additionally, the U.S National Institute for Standards and Technologies (NIST) is currently developing a privacy framework that is likely to extend beyond notions of legal compliance and provide a common language for approaching and mitigating potential threats associated with the increased collection of information, including voice information.</p><p>By building tools in a way that respects \u201cprivacy by design,\u201d entities can make sure they are appropriately considering data protection from the outset. One example is the incorporation of blockchain as a potential decentralized solution for voice data protection, and French startup Snips is leaning into this idea of decentralization by building its software to run 100% on-device, independently from the cloud. Unlike more mainstream, centralized virtual assistants, Snips knows nothing about its users.Privacy and Security</p><p>The more data collected through the use of voice technologies, the more risk information could be disclosed to governments or compromised by bad actors\u2014a particularly ominous notion when voice data-specific human rights have yet to be defined.</p><p>\u201cTo the extent platforms store biometrics, they are vulnerable to government demands for access and disclosure,\u201d noted Albert Gidari, director of privacy at the Stanford Center for Internet and Society. What government actors can then do with that information is potentially boundless. One example is the United States National Security Agency (NSA), where it was recently revealed that technology exists to analyze the physical and behavioral features that make each person\u2019s voice distinctive, such as the pitch, shape of the mouth, and length of the larynx. An algorithm creates a dynamic computer model of the individual\u2019s vocal characteristics--their voiceprint.</p><p>Globally, similar discussions are taking place at the government level. HMRC, the United Kingdom\u2019s tax authority, has collected 5.1 million taxpayers\u2019 voiceprints as part of its new voice identification policy. Advocacy groups reported HMRC\u2019s system repeatedly asks users to create their \u201cvoice ID\u201d without giving them instructions on how to opt out. In China, the government has been using voice data in conjunction with other biometric data and tracking technologies to target and surveil minority communities.</p><p>The existence of this data also provides a new attack surface for bad actors. With major data breaches in the news every week, the threat of unauthorized access to databases of voice data could provoke immeasurable damage, particularly as companies are increasingly turning to this type of biometric data to authenticate users for access to their personal accounts.</p><p>International law and policy are starting to take shape to provide guidance in these areas. The Necessary and Proportionate principles provide a rights-based framework to limit government access to personal information, though few countries have yet to adopt it. The Digital Geneva Convention is currently a draft private sector effort, while public sector forces are urging the UN Human Rights Committee to issue a new General Comment on the right to privacy under Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime is keenly focused on the topic.</p><p>It is clear there is a need for more and better national surveillance and cybersecurity laws and policies to help codify protections for these categories of personal data, including biometric information.Have you read?</p><p>Voice technology could soon be your new best friend. Here's why 3 ways voice technology will change your life Data protection is not just about protecting our personal information</p><p>Fraud</p><p>Deep fakes and fraud are already surging problems in the world of online video, and U.S lawmakers are already sounding the alarm about similar issues in the audio space.</p><p>Fraud is a growing problem in voice technology, with voice fraud rates growing more than 350% since 2013 across a variety of industries. Today, the same deep-learning technology that enables the modification of videos without detection can also be used to create audio clips that sound like real people.</p><p>Big technology firms all over the world are developing technology to clone anyone\u2019s voice, such as the \u201cDeep Voice\u201d AI algorithm developed by Chinese firm Baidu that can clone anyone\u2019s voice in just 3.7 seconds. Over the course of a year, the technology went from requiring about 30 minutes to create a new fake video to, now, just seconds.</p><p>Meanwhile, this need to fight fraud is leading to new innovation. Pindrop, for example, is a startup that recently raised $90M to bring its voice-fraud protection to IoT devices and the European continent. They claim their platform can identify even the most sophisticated fakes by analyzing almost 1,400 acoustic attributes, which enables it to effectively verify a legitimate voice file.</p><p>Academia is also leaning in to help prevent fraud. MIT Technology Review reported Berkeley researchers are able to \u201ctake a waveform and add a layer of noise that fools DeepSpeech, a state-of-the-art speech-to-text AI, every time. The technique can make music sound like arbitrary speech to the AI, or obscure voices so they aren\u2019t transcribed.\u201d</p><p>There are steps that can be taken to ensure privacy in voice-driven platforms, provide data security on the backend, and fight the risk of fraud. This means increasing access to information and education to help inform the general public, perhaps including new curriculum additions to global school systems. It also means meaningful legislation and genuine public/private sector collaboration.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IMNWSE-INS2296540I</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IMNWSE2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTV-9W41-F0YC-N16P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">438631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1480\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Impact Media Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Impact News Service</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"56562\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 15, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Tonight, the wheels are set in motion on Volkswagen's giant recall. The company has announced one of the biggest recalls in auto history. It's trying to rectify the cars that cheat on emissions tests.</p><p>You'll remember originally Volkswagen had hoped to do it as a voluntary recall, and they weren't even using the word \"recall.\" Well, no longer.

Well, let's face it, this scandal, I mean, although those involved have been negotiating it for a year or two, the rest of the world -- the rest of us have only known about it for the last couple of months.</p><p>EWING: Yes. No, the way it hit was amazing. It's -- one day we found out there was the cheating, and then just an incredible amount of stuff has happened since, that it's totally turned Volkswagen upside-down.</p><p>QUEST: We'll leave the movie to one side, but in terms of the book, what do you aim for the book to do? What do you want it to discover?</p><p>EWING: Well, I think there's two goals. One, I just want to tell the story, and I -- the big question that everybody wants to know is, who is responsible for this inside Volkswagen? What kind of management mistakes allowed this to happen? I think that's one part of the story.</p><p>And then, I'm also looking at the broader issue of what this means for businesses in general? What does this say about the way businesses operate today?</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk on that issue, because when I heard it, initially you thought, well, this can't be true. I mean, it's so outrageous. And then you heard the testimony last -- two weeks ago in front of Congress, where basically, they lied. And now we're hearing that there may have been dozens of engineers in Volkswagen who knew about this.</p><p>EWING: Yes, well, it's hard to believe that something that was installed in 11 million cars, that that was the work of a very small group of people. There had to be a number of people involved.</p><p>[16:05:02] And I think that's what we still don't know, is how far did this go? How high did it go? And why did Volkswagen not have systems in place that would prevent this type of problem from reaching a point where it could really threaten the entire company?</p><p>QUEST: When I look at BP and Macondo and the Gulf of Mexico, there was an incident, and there was no real -- there were certain cultural problems that allowed it to happen, but the company had to move quickly to protect the balance sheet, selling off assets and all that sort of thing.</p><p>Do you expect the same sort of actions now from Volkswagen? We know they've already cut capex. But what more do you think Volkswagen will have to do?</p><p>EWING: I think they'll wait as long as they can before they start selling off unites, like Lamborghini or Bentley, some of those, some of the family silver, so to speak. But I think the main effect that is it's going to hurt their ability to invest in new technologies.</p><p>QUEST: And finally, is the book going to be sexy, and who's going to play the leading role?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: You knew I was going to ask you that.</p><p>EWING: Sexy? I don't know, I don't have any sex scenes yet, and that might be a little hard to come up with. Leading roles? I think DiCaprio would make a great Martin Winterkorn, but that's up to him. I have no idea what he's planning to do.</p><p>QUEST: Martin Winterkorn, Leonardo DiCaprio. I'll come to the opening night. Thank you very much.</p><p>EWING: Great, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Now, the latest recall news sent Volkswagen stock plummeting in Germany. Join me at the super screens, and you'll see how the markets traded. Which -- when you think of what happened to Volkswagen and put it into the context of the other markets, you'll see.</p><p>Take, say, for example the Xetra DAX. This was how the one day trading, you have that very sharp fall there, reflecting it. The markets had a good day in Europe, except, obviously, for certain stocks. The Xetra DAX was up 1.5 percent.</p><p>Just show you how it's gone over the last six months. That's, obviously, the crisis over the last few weeks. The FTSE was also up more than 1 percent. Paris and -- similarly, they were all up.</p><p>There was weak US data, which suggested interest rates will not rise this year. In fact, there's been a whole slew of economic data suggesting now that interest rates won't rise despite what Janet Yellen said in a recent speech.</p><p>Two members of the Fed Board -- the FOMC -- are now believed to believe that it should be pushed into next month, so dissension within the Fed is starting to become a real issue.</p><p>From here onwards, 12:00 onwards, and the market goes on an absolute tear, back over 17,000. But what happened this afternoon? What happened this afternoon that caused all this to take place? We'll talk about that as we also talk about earnings with Paul La Monica. Good to see you, Paul.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Nice to see you. What happened at 12:00 during the day that enabled the market to suddenly rise so sharply?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I'm not sure there was a specific event that caused that day-end rally, but as you pointed out, people are growing more comfortable with the notion that the Fed is going to stick with zero percent interest rates for a couple more months, perhaps into early 2016.</p><p>And while a few weeks ago, people complained about that, now I think people are partying because it means more of the easy money flowing.</p><p>QUEST: OK, so, we also had earnings results, which I'm just going to remind. Goldman Sachs had a third quarter miss, where net income fell. But there was a concern particularly with Goldman Sachs -- the stock was up, but it was about bond trading, wasn't it? It was fixed income --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- that was the cause of the problem.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, the big drop there. Fixed income, currencies, commodities.</p><p>QUEST: So, if Goldman was down on earnings and it misses, why is the stock up 3 percent?</p><p>LA MONICA: It's a great question. There's a couple of things, I think, at play. One, people are hoping because the market has stabilized since late August, that the worst of the turmoil is now over, fourth quarter trading numbers should be better.</p><p>Also, Goldman's showing a lot more discipline. Their compensation expenses, the quote-unquote \"bonus pool,\" it's down 16 percent from a year ago. So, the company is not rewarding its employees as lavishly, because times aren't as good.</p><p>QUEST: One man who's not going to be rewarded as lavishly is Christopher Bailey at Burberry.</p><p>LA MONICA: Not at all.</p><p>QUEST: Burberry's results -- \"It was an increasingly challenging environment,\" is how they describe it. But Burberry is related to China, large numbers of sales in China, and that's down sharply. Is this a bloody nose, if you like, for Bailey?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think it is. China and Hong Kong are clearly a problem. But he is not alone. Every luxury retailer, and many retailers around the world with exposure to China, are going to have difficult, at least for the third quarter. Again, will things stabilize in the fourth quarter? Because Chinese stocks have surged as well so far this month.</p><p>QUEST: I need to as you about debt. I see -- I'm just looking at the screen -- that the US government has announced basically that the federal deficit was $439 billion in fiscal 15, which was $144 billion --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- less, giving a deficit of 2.5 percent. That's remarkable numbers.</p><p>[16:10:04] LA MONICA: It is. I think what's really happening here is that even though it's fashionable to complain about the sluggish growth in the US economy, the US economy has grown steadily, even if it's not spectacular, and you've seen that with the job market. More people with jobs equals more payroll taxes. More revenue coming in, even though we're still spending a lot, that leads to a lower deficit.</p><p>QUEST: Even so, it means the deficit's not a problem.</p><p>LA MONICA: No, of course the deficit is a problem for the long term. We also have that debt ceiling debate, I mean --</p><p>QUEST: Ah! Leave the debt ceiling!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LA MONICA: We are not out of the woods.</p><p>QUEST: Leave the debt ceiling!</p><p>LA MONICA: Washington is still a mess.</p><p>QUEST: You said it, not me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: When we come back, a 90-day ban could have cost him his bid to be the next FIFA president, and now it seems Michel Platini still has the support of some very important allies. It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS from New York.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: UEFA is still backing its president to clear his name. Michel Platini's plans to become the next FIFA president were derailed when FIFA banned him for allegedly taking a disloyal payment from Sepp Blatter. Now, he's won the unanimous support and backing from Europe's football authorities.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIANNI INFANTINO, SECRETARY GENERAL, UEFA: We support Michel Platini's right to a due process and a fair trial and to the opportunity to clear his name.</p><p>We strongly call on all instances involved in the current process, FIFA's ethics committee, FIFA's appeal committee and, ultimately, the court of arbitration for sport, to work very rapidly to ensure that there is a final decision on the merits of the case by, at the latest, mid-November 2015.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Is Platini's aims and efforts derailed? UEFA says it doesn't want February's election for FIFA presidency to be delayed. The problem is, there aren't too many candidates left who aren't facing some form of corruption or some allegation of misdeeds and miscreant behavior.</p><p>Now, Sepp Blatter has already been -- said he won't run. The election is because he said he's stepping down. And anyway, he is suspended for 90 days. Platini was one of the front-runners, but now he's also been suspended for 90 days.</p><p>[16:15:05] As for the Korean billionaire, Chung Mong-joon, he's been banned for six years. He was suspended over the bids for the next two World Cups. Which really just leaves us at the end with Prince Ali bin al- Hussein of Jordan, who lost to Blatter in the election this year.</p><p>You might -- and you would be perhaps reasonable if you say this lot couldn't run the proverbial in a brewery. Don Riddell is at the CNN Center and joins me now. Mr. Riddell, two of the three candidates are suspended. I mean, how on Earth do they get out of this mess?</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Well, yes, that's the $64 million question, Richard. I might perhaps have given Michel Platini a yellow card, in your graphic there. A red card would suggest that he's completely out of the running.</p><p>But you've heard that UEFA are going to give him their backing. And the way I understand that is, he's got our backing for now. They want him to go through the due process, where he has the opportunity to clear his name, and they are insisting that that is done as quickly as possible, by mid-November.</p><p>But it may well be that regardless of their backing, he can't run for the presidency anyway, because he's submitted his paperwork, he's one of only two men, he and Prince Ali, to have actually have got to that stage with 11 days to go until the deadline --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RIDDELL: -- on October the 26th. But he's still got to go through an integrity check, and it may well be that FIFA determined he isn't fit to run for the presidency anyway.</p><p>QUEST: Now, can UEFA just ignore FIFA on this basis and say, let's face it, you're all so corrupt, and it's such a shambles, that if we want Platini to stay as head as UEFA, what are you going to do about it? UEFA is by far and away the biggest at the table.</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, I mean, today's meeting was really to determine whether or not Platini has their support for the FIFA presidency. What they were discussing today wasn't whether or not he's fit to be able to continue on as the UEFA president.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RIDDELL: Incidentally, even though he's been banned from all football-related activities for 90 days, UEFA said today that he's still getting paid as the UEFA president. So, it's easy to get mixed up in what actually people are all talking about here. But essentially, what was going on today was whether or not UEFA --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RIDDELL: -- supports Platini to run for the FIFA presidency. And right now, they do. But as you say, there's only two men in the running, and it's really hard to see how this process can go forward and take place on February the 26th with any degree of credibility.</p><p>QUEST: In a sentence, Don, are you still aghast at just how awful this is?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RIDDELL: None of this comes as any surprise anymore. It's very difficult to be shocked or surprised by any of this, Richard. But it is an absolute fiasco for sure.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Don Riddell, thank you very much. Our FIFA fiasco correspondent, Don Riddell, bringing us up there.</p><p>Swiss watchmaker Hublot is a major FIFA sponsor. Now, Hublot was the official timekeeper of the 2014 World Cup. As you can see. And it will reprise that role in 2018. While many sponsors have either cut ties with FIFA or called for Blatter to step down, Hublot has done neither.</p><p>So now, we're going to give the head of Hublot, the chief exec, Jean- Claude Biver, the chance to actually say in clear terms, sir, what do you think about the current fiasco with FIFA? What do you want to happen?</p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE BIVER, CEO, HUBLOT: I want the truth to come out. I want clarity. I want to know what has happened. For the time being, I can only say there's a presumption of innocence. At least in Europe, that's how I think.</p><p>I want to know what has happened. I want to -- I'm looking forward to the 24th of November, when we will definitely know. Now, for me, for our brand --</p><p>QUEST: It's damaging.</p><p>BIVER: It's not damaging us.</p><p>QUEST: Yet.</p><p>BIVER: You know why? Because we are part of the referee. We hold the referee board. So, we are linked to the referees and to the game more, somehow, than other sponsors, who are around the field.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So, I'm not going to dwell for long on this, because we have other things to talk about, but to be clear, should Blatter go sooner rather than later?</p><p>BIVER: No. He should go -- when he has to go. Why should he go now? If he goes now, means somehow he is guilty. I mean, why should he go? He has a term, which is end of February, or something like that. He should -- I mean, he's suspended. So we're talking now -- he's out of there anymore.</p><p>[16:20:05] QUEST: Had you had had any moment had any doubts about whether you should continue to sponsor --</p><p>BIVER: Never. We didn't have a single doubt, because it will -- if FIFA has a problem, it doesn't mean football has a problem. And FIFA --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: But as FIFA's problem has continued, sponsors could have acted sooner, could have put commercial pressure sooner. Do you agree?</p><p>BIVER: Eventually, yes, but there was no doubt that anything was wrong. I have been knowing Blatter since 40 years. I cannot imagine today that he did something wrong, voluntary.</p><p>QUEST: You've announced a Tag Heuer sponsorship with Tom Brady.</p><p>BIVER: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Which, of course, is a new venture. I hesitate to suggest Deflategate, but you do seem to have a knack for sponsoring people who might have issues in the controversial area, don't you?</p><p>BIVER: Yes. We are disruptive.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BIVER: Disruption is creativity. The innovation disrupts the past. And somehow, we believe in people, whatever is said on the right or on the left side. And by the way, Tom Brady is -- he was cleared and he is totally innocent.</p><p>QUEST: Well, the court has cleared him, yes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BIVER: That's a lot.</p><p>QUEST: Well, on appeal, it cleared him. There's still the question of well -- but you had no doubt with that either, with Brady?</p><p>BIVER: I have no doubt with Brady.</p><p>QUEST: Yes?</p><p>BIVER: And I have no doubt -- I must say, it seems strange, I have no doubt with Michel Platini, and I have no doubt with Blatter.</p><p>QUEST: How much is this watch that I'm holding?</p><p>BIVER: $5,000 US, or 5,000 Swiss francs. Today, it's the same price.</p><p>QUEST: Tell me!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: I was in Geneva this morning! I was in Geneva this morning. How on Earth do people live in that city? It's so expensive.</p><p>BIVER: I think New York is more expensive for me than Geneva. I had a beer in the airport, a Budweiser, and I paid $6. I said to myself, that cannot be possible.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: You're selling $5,000 watches. You can afford it, sir.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: Right, let's just put this in a safe. You won't be needing this for the moment.</p><p>There's a new front that we're going to be talking about with the Freedom Project. It follows in just a moment.

CNN's Clare Sebastian exposes a problem, which literally could be happening across the corridor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On a ran of the hotel, the guy at the front desk looked at me.

It happens all over. It's not like there's one bad company or one bad place. Frankly, pimps and traffickers don't really car.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The card now has more than 1200 signatories worldwide. At last count, 223 are full members, who report to ECPAT every year. Hilton became a member in 2011.</p><p>JENNIFER SILBERMAN, SENIOR MANAGER, HILTON WORLDWIDE: Infusing this into our overall training agenda or curriculum. It was really something that was very natural for us, because we are a training organization. I think first and foremost, it was developing a training that would make sense for our team members.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Hilton now relies on a combination of this online training and face-to-face classes. Hotel staff are taught to look for possible red flags and report them to the hotel manager, who will decide whether to involve law enforcement.</p><p>CRAIG WILLIAMS, GENERAL MANAGER, HILTON NEWARK AIRPORT: The Guest Service agents will be looking for things like cash-paying guests, large groups of young children.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): What are the room attendants -- what are the cleaners looking for?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Unusual situations in the room, alcohol, drugs.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): It's an uncomfortable reality for an industry built on hospitality, holidays, happy times.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): And yet, signing ECPAT's code, like Hilton has done, is not the only way that this industry is tackling this darker side. Some companies, for example, have their own specific policies.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Companies like Starwood Hotels and American Airlines have implemented training programs of their own. There are also other NGOs, like Airline Ambassadors, an ECPAT signatory, which trains airport and airline staff in the US.</p><p>And there's raising public awareness. Marriott International is a major sponsor of the UN's Be a Responsible Traveler program.

Those are my mother's initials.</p><p>Anyway, no word yet on the number of shares or indeed the price range. Square launched in 2009. It's now valued at $6 billion.</p><p>Why to go public now for a tech company is a serious question investors may want to know.</p><p>There've been just 17 tech IPOs in 2015 which is the lowest number since 2009. And when you look at the performance, they are some of the worst that we've seen in the second quarter.</p><p>For instance, (RINGS BELL) Etsy down 63 percent since an April debut, Box down 46 percent since the debut in January.</p><p>Alibaba, GoPro, GrubHub - they were all sharply down over the course of the year.

It's away from the market and you're less likely to suffer the effects.</p><p>Samuel Burke joins me now from London. Why has tech had such a bad rap in IPOs, bearing in mind to a man, woman and child, we agree tech is the future?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, what happened is you had a lot of the big tech companies - Facebook, Twitter - and they came out and they had great IPOs - Twitter at first, not so much anymore for their stuff.</p><p>But what a lot of companies saw was these great sexy IPOs and they wanted to follow in their footsteps. But by the time they reached the market, they already had a lot of competitors and so it hasn't gone quite as well for them.</p><p>And when it comes to Square, Richard, we've learned a lot. They earn a lot of money, they spend a lot of money, but at the end of the day, they're still not profitable.</p><p>Just take a look at these numbers, Richard. Revenue is up for Square 54 percent to $850 million. Losses increased to $154 million though. Most surprising of all, their deal to process Starbucks has actually caused them to lose $28 million.</p><p>But at the end of the day, I'll get back to your question. Here we see razor-thin margins and a very competitive field --</p><p>QUEST: Right, but -</p><p>BURKE: -- the same thing that has hurt the other IPOs.</p><p>QUEST: The difference though with something like Square and it's always a risk of newer technology or a better mousetrap, but at least they're making a product which is clearly in demand. They've got competitors unlike some companies which are just mist on the waters.</p><p>BURKE: That's right, and that's part of the reason that they want to do their IPO. And they know they've got the revenue coming in, they need the money to continue to attract new clients.</p><p>But another reason that they want to do it - because they just want to stay ahead of the competition. A lot of people recognize that if Square doesn't act now, those competitors are going to get the best of them.</p><p>And yes, there's a lull but a lot of people are expecting big numbers for those other companies and it shows.</p><p>QUEST: So, I know Square obviously warned about Dorsey spending time between Square and Twitter. How much of that is a real concern? Because new companies - I mean, most companies - shouldn't just be completely dependent on the chief executive.</p><p>But new companies tend to be more reliant on the ability of the CEO.</p><p>BURKE: And this is uncharted territory. It's very rare to see the CEO of two companies of this size in charge - Jack Dorsey in charge of Twitter, Jack Dorsey in charge of Square.</p><p>Take a look at this little nugget that I found in there prospectus, and it took some people by surprise because Jack Dorsey has been so confident. He said -- or rather in the prospectus for Square - they say quote, \"This may at times adversely affect his ability {Jack Dorsey's ability}to devote time, attention and effort to Square.</p><p>Now, when I talked to Jack Dorsey about his last year, he said, listen, they're right next door to each other, I can easily cross the street and go from one to another.</p><p>He makes it sound almost as easy as you, Richard, going from one show to another - \"Business Traveler\" to \"Quest Means Business,\" but it might be a little bit tougher than that. At least that's what some of the investors are thinking.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, I mean, many CEOs run much bigger companies than those two and manage to do so successfully. Dorsey can do it. (RINGS BELL). Thank you, Samuel Burke in London.</p><p>Coming soon to a stock exchange near you, an IMAX IPO in Hong Kong that's been a blockbuster success.

We filed in around April or May. I was there in June for kind of pre-IPO meetings and I felt like the hottest commodity in town. I had 61 meetings and people were like how much can I buy, how fast?</p><p>And then we had planned on going right around Labor Day, and the markets had been really volatile and as you know they devalued the ranum be (ph) and the market hit its lowest point in two years.</p><p>And sure I was worried. I mean, you know, you could not be worried.</p><p>QUEST: So why didn't you pull it? Because we've seen cases - I remember WizzAir in London literally pulled their IPO within days of when it was supposed to happen. Why did you decide not do that?</p><p>GELFOND: Because we were going to own 70 percent of it after the IPO happened and we were only selling 7 percent in the IPO.</p><p>So I wasn't so concerned about what the price was in the IPO as I was about where it traded in the aftermarket so we could create long-term value which is why we did it.</p><p>So I view windows as either opened or closed and, you know, I didn't need the last nickel and it made sense for me to wait a while to see if we could sneak through.</p><p>And the Fed didn't raise interest rates as you know at the end of September and we found a window.</p><p>QUEST: This is fascinating because I'm getting real insight into the sort of decisions you have to make and we often don't hear about in terms of an IPO.</p><p>In the days after and the week after, we've seen this 35 percent rise in the level. What's driving that? Is it speculation or is it fundamental?</p><p>GELFOND: I think it's more fundamental. I think one reason that it was priced lower than it could have been is where investors were just skittish about IPOs in general.</p><p>[16:45:04] QUEST: But that really - but that meant leaving some money on the table.</p><p>GELFOND: That meant leaving money on the table, but our book was very strong. We were more than five times oversubscribed and remember this is discretionary consumer in China.</p><p>This isn't export, this isn't manufacturing, and that segment has done extremely well, Richard. So I felt good about it.</p><p>There's a lot of demand, the road shows were full, and I think the bankers who did a good job priced it deliberately a little lower so it would trade well.</p><p>QUEST: And what did you do with the money?</p><p>GELFOND: Some of the money is going to be reinvested in China and we're going to build a post-production facility, a screening room, invest in more theater deals in China, more joint ventures.</p><p>And then the amount we sell - the amount we sold - we're going to keep on our balance sheet to do better things.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, sir, I appreciate it.</p><p>GELFOND: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed. Now from the small screen - from the big screen and the small screen - to the very small screen.</p><p>GoPro is used for all sorts of extreme sports and GoPro shares have been on an extreme downhill slide. GoPro's fallen more than 50 percent this year.</p><p>The company does have ambitions to get some uplift - it's taking on the drone market. And its chief exec Nick Woodman told Maggie Lake that the company plans to roll out its own version of (GESTURES) next year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>NICK WOODMAN, CEO, GOPRO: We definitely are on track to introduce our drone for the first half of 2016, and we're really excited about it.</p><p>And it's going to be a differentiated experience that I think is going to be extremely well received by GoPro existing and new customers.</p><p>Even though we don't yet have a drone product in the market, I think GoPro has been such a big part of why consumers are so interested in drones and in other flying camera solutions -- because the drone market really took off when people started mounting GoPros specifically on drones.</p><p>A lot of the drones that are flying, they already are GoPros in a sense, and so I think that that gives us a distinct advantage against say another company that was entering the market that had no history in that space whatsoever.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: GoPro in the market and Rich Gelfond pulling us right in terms of the price at which his IPO. It was fascinating actually to hear an IPO - to hear a CEO - talk about an IPO, something they're often frequently reluctant to do so.</p><p>Here in the United States you are expected to tip on just about everything. Now a campaign has begun to curb the tipping activity. There's a major boost to the anti-tipping movement. @RichardQuest on your thoughts of what you think about tipping.</p><p>We're going to talk about it after you've watched a highlight from \"Make, Create, Innovate.\" (RINGS BELL).</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:50:43] QUEST: Welcome to the restaurant. You are most welcome. And now one of New York's top restauranteurs has joined the no-tipping movement.</p><p>Danny Meyer's banning the practice at his full-service restaurants starting late next month. It's a major change for New Yorkers. Indeed, tipping is pretty much engrained in this society.</p><p>For instance, look at what TripAdvisor says, \"Tipping is a part of our service economy and our taxation system, and all visitors should understand that it is part of our local culture.\"</p><p>Is it really? Joining me now to talk about this is Drew Neiporent, the owner of Myriad Restaurant Group. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>DREW NIEPORENT, OWNER, MYRIAD RESTAURANT GROUP: Likewise. Did you leave a tip the last time you were at Nobu?</p><p>QUEST: The bill -</p><p>NIEPORENT: Maybe not because in London it's value added, right? And it's 12 points price (ph) -</p><p>QUEST: No, no - you still -- there's still a tip -- a line for the tip you can always add in. But here's the point, here's the point - are you going to follow Meyer and other's lead in this regard or are you just thinking about whether you should?</p><p>NIEPORENT: No, we've though this - you know - Danny and I actually came up together in 1985 at a restaurant called Mon Triche (ph). They still have Trifecta Grill and Nobu for over 25 years. No, but whatever.</p><p>Danny's a terrific person and perhaps this works for his group. Economics of the restaurant business are miserable, Richard. They just don't work.</p><p>And the tipping equation is part of American culture, and it might work for Danny Meyer, but it doesn't work for the vast majority of restaurants in this country.</p><p>QUEST: But the problem is not tipping per se because, you know, wherever you travel in the world you leave a tip on the restaurant.</p><p>It's got out of control in the United States some people would say. This idea of a 20 percent tip - on a meal that was probably quite expensive to start with.</p><p>NIEPORENT: But, Richard, let me tell you. These are hardworking people and, you know, this is a complicated issue. I would acknowledge that.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>NIEPORENT: But to just go to the extreme. You're not a stupid person - if you're leaving 20 percent on $100, that's $20. Danny Meyer's going to charge you 30 percent more on the prices.</p><p>So he's looking at you and he's saying, you know what, you don't have to leave a tip. But he's banging you for another 30 percent, not 20 percent. And that is where the problem lies.</p><p>He's not doing you any favors.</p><p>QUEST: I wonder though when you talk about this, I've always had the feeling that you're transferring your wage bill to me.</p><p>NIEPORENT: OK that's - but everything is transferred to you. You're the customer. Everything that we charge based - is based on - us being able to meet our expenses to be able to stay in business.</p><p>And you're looking at somebody who's opened over 40 restaurants in the last 30 years, all around the world including in the communist country known as California -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NIEPORENT: And where I did pay wages of $10 per hour, and guess what? Everyone got paid except for us, the investors.</p><p>QUEST: So would you be in favor or do you believe that tipping should be withheld in the case of bad service? Unlike as it (AUDIO GAP) somebody run down the street after me saying you didn't leave me a big enough tip.</p><p>We've all heard those stories. But -</p><p>NIEPORENT: As long as they didn't do anything to your food while you were still there. But the answer is -</p><p>QUEST: (LAUGHTER).</p><p>NIEPORENT: -- of course, Richard, you're allowed - you're the guest.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NIEPORENT: And if you don't receive commensurate service, you're entitled to leave whatever you desire which includes zero.</p><p>But the truth is, is that we're in a service business and these people work hard and they deserve that 15 or 20 percent that you've been leaving - that millions of people tonight will leave in restaurants in New York City.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think the law should be changed in the United States so that tips can be shared? Tips coming through to the front -</p><p>NIEPORENT: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: -- because many people don't realize that tips given to waiters or the waiting staff cannot be shared by federal law with those back of house.</p><p>NIEPORENT: Absolutely, because the generation that you're looking at in Danny Meyer, what we did want to try to do when we first came up was make the system equitable.</p><p>And that would have been to take gratuities and share them equitably with our entire staff. And then we got kicked in the teeth because there were lawsuit after lawsuit - basically ambulance-chasing attorneys. None of these things got adjudicated in law, we all have to settle because you know how lawyers can be.</p><p>And anyway, the bottom line is, yes, without a question the law should be changed about the distribution of gratuities.</p><p>[16:55:05] QUEST: I wish I had a glass to say cheers.</p><p>NIEPORENT: I was about to say, this is the only time I had never been offered a glass of wine (LAUGHTER). Thank you, Richard, you're tremendous at what you do.</p><p>QUEST: Next time in your restaurant.</p><p>NIEPORENT: I hope so. Thank you very much.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>NIEPORENT: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: We will have a \"Profitable Moment\" after the break.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\" Claire Sebastian brought us a report this evening that showed how the hospitality industry is dealing with the very serious question of child sex trafficking.</p><p>It's gratifying to see that an industry which so often wants to look in the opposite direction is finally admitting that there is a problem and they're going to do something about it.</p><p>The World Tourism Organization has for a long time made it clear that things have to change. And if you ever try and get a tourist company to talk about something as serious as this, well they just push it to one side.</p><p>It's the nasty side of tourism that nobody ever wants to face up to.</p><p>Thankfully people like Hilton, Marriott, the big airlines are now saying that they will not shove this aside. They will acknowledge there's a problem and they will do something about it.</p><p>There's absolutely no room in any form of an industry for the sort of industry - child sex tourism - that has been taking place. And the gratification that now those companies are doing something about it must be celebrated.</p><p>And that is \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight. I'm Richard Quest back in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, (RINGS BELL) I hope it's profitable. We'll do it again tomorrow.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2015 Cable News Network, Inc.

Look at  how the graph goes up as the market rose from 12:00 onwards, with a strong  one and a third percent gain at the end of the session.  And the man at the  --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(GAVEL POUNDS)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QUEST:  Ooh.  That is what you call a wimpy gavel on Thursday, October  the 15th.</p><p>Back it into the garage.  Germany orders a massive recall of  Volkswagen cars.</p><p>It's a square offering in a market that's gone pear-shaped.</p><p>And think of it as the tipping point, as one restaurateur takes the  power to tip out of your hands.  </p><p>I'm Richard Quest, back in New York, where of course I mean business.</p><p>Good evening.  Tonight, the wheels are set in motion on Volkswagen's  giant recall.  The company has announced one of the biggest recalls in auto  history.  It's trying to rectify the cars that cheat on emissions tests.</p><p>You'll remember originally Volkswagen had hoped to do it as a  voluntary recall, and they weren't even using the word \"recall.\"  Well, no  longer.  Now the company is to recall 8.5 million diesel vehicles.  The  work will begin in January, and VW says there'll be no cost to the  customer.  That's generous of them.</p><p>It comes after German regulators ordered a mandatory recall of a  couple of million cars.  Germany's transport minister said Volkswagen had  no choice.  They had to get the cars off the road.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDER DORBRINDT, GERMAN TRANSPORT MINISTER (through translator):   The KBA believes this to be a case of software using an unreliable defeat  device.  VW must now remove the corresponding software from all vehicles  and take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with emission  regulations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  This latest recall only makes the emissions scandal go deeper  and more expensive for Volkswagen.  The events of the past month have been  so dramatic that Leonard DiCaprio has already bought the film rights to a  Volkswagen book, even though the author, Jack Ewing, hasn't written the  book yet.  We'll talk about that with the author in a moment.  But all the  twists and turns have inspired us to give VW the Hollywood treatment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL HORN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, VOLKSWAGEN GROUP OF AMERICA:  In my  German words, we've totally screwed up.</p><p>MARTIN WINTERKORN, CEO, VOLKSWAGEN (through translator):  The  irregularities in our group's diesel engines go against everything  Volkswagen stands for.</p><p>LAUREN FIX, CAR COACH:  This is a very serious situation because it's  a trust issue issue more than anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  There can be no winking, no blinking on how you  meet regulations around the globe.</p><p>REP. JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS:  Do you really believe that senior-level  corporate managers had no knowledge for years and years?</p><p>HORN:  I agree it's very hard to believe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  I'd go and watch that movie.  The question is, is it the book  that Jack Ewing of the \"New York Times\" is going to write?  Joins me now.   Sir.  So, you're writing the book, and I know that's what you're here to  talk about.  Tell me why did you decide to do it?</p><p>JACK EWING, EUROPEAN ECONOMICS COMMENTATOR, \"NEW YORK TIMES\":  Well,  to be quite honest, a publisher approached me, Norton, and asked me if I  would be interested in doing it.  That was only about three weeks ago, and  things have moved very quickly since then.  I have a great agent, Marly  Rusoff, who took it to Hollywood, and you know the rest.</p><p>QUEST:  Are you surprised at the speed at which this has happened?</p><p>EWING:  Yes, very -- you mean in terms of it going to Hollywood?</p><p>QUEST:  The whole process.  Well, let's face it, this scandal, I mean,  although those involved have been negotiating it for a year or two, the  rest of the world -- the rest of us have only known about it for the last  couple of months.</p><p>EWING:  Yes.  No, the way it hit was amazing.  It's -- one day we  found out there was the cheating, and then just an incredible amount of  stuff has happened since, that it's totally turned Volkswagen upside-down.</p><p>QUEST:  We'll leave the movie to one side, but in terms of the book,  what do you aim for the book to do?  What do you want it to discover?</p><p>EWING:  Well, I think there's two goals.  One, I just want to tell the  story, and I -- the big question that everybody wants to know is, who is  responsible for this inside Volkswagen?  What kind of management mistakes  allowed this to happen?  I think that's one part of the story. </p><p>And then, I'm also looking at the broader issue of what this means for  businesses in general?  What does this say about the way businesses operate  today?</p><p>QUEST:  Let's talk on that issue, because when I heard it, initially  you thought, well, this can't be true.  I mean, it's so outrageous.  And  then you heard the testimony last -- two weeks ago in front of Congress,  where basically, they lied.  And now we're hearing that there may have been  dozens of engineers in Volkswagen who knew about this.</p><p>EWING:  Yes, well, it's hard to believe that something that was  installed in 11 million cars, that that was the work of a very small group  of people.  There had to be a number of people involved.  </p><p>[16:05:02]  And I think that's what we still don't know, is how far  did this go?  How high did it go?  And why did Volkswagen not have systems  in place that would prevent this type of problem from reaching a point  where it could really threaten the entire company?</p><p>QUEST:  When I look at BP and Macondo and the Gulf of Mexico, there  was an incident, and there was no real -- there were certain cultural  problems that allowed it to happen, but the company had to move quickly to  protect the balance sheet, selling off assets and all that sort of thing.  </p><p>Do you expect the same sort of actions now from Volkswagen?  We know  they've already cut capex.  But what more do you think Volkswagen will have  to do?</p><p>EWING:  I think they'll wait as long as they can before they start  selling off unites, like Lamborghini or Bentley, some of those, some of the  family silver, so to speak.  But I think the main effect that is it's going  to hurt their ability to invest in new technologies.</p><p>QUEST:  And finally, is the book going to be sexy, and who's going to  play the leading role?  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST:  You knew I was going to ask you that.</p><p>EWING:  Sexy?  I don't know, I don't have any sex scenes yet, and that  might be a little hard to come up with.  Leading roles?  I think DiCaprio  would make a great Martin Winterkorn, but that's up to him.  I have no idea  what he's planning to do.</p><p>QUEST:  Martin Winterkorn, Leonardo DiCaprio.  I'll come to the  opening night.  Thank you very much.</p><p>EWING:  Great, Richard.</p><p>QUEST:  Good to see you.  Now, the latest recall news sent Volkswagen  stock plummeting in Germany.  Join me at the super screens, and you'll see  how the markets traded.  Which -- when you think of what happened to  Volkswagen and put it into the context of the other markets, you'll see.  </p><p>Take,  say, for example the Xetra DAX.  This was how the one day  trading, you have that very sharp fall there, reflecting it.  The markets  had a good day in Europe, except, obviously, for certain stocks.  The Xetra  DAX was up 1.5 percent.  </p><p>Just show you how it's gone over the last six months.  That's,  obviously, the crisis over the last few weeks.  The FTSE was also up more  than 1 percent.  Paris and -- similarly, they were all up.  </p><p>There was weak US data, which suggested interest rates will not rise  this year.  In fact, there's been a whole slew of economic data suggesting  now that interest rates won't rise despite what Janet Yellen said in a  recent speech.  </p><p>Two members of the Fed Board -- the FOMC -- are now believed to  believe that it should be pushed into next month, so dissension within the  Fed is starting to become a real issue.</p><p>From here onwards, 12:00 onwards, and the market goes on an absolute  tear, back over 17,000.  But what happened this afternoon?  What happened  this afternoon that caused all this to take place?  We'll talk about that  as we also talk about earnings with Paul La Monica.  Good to see you, Paul.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT:  Thank you.  </p><p>QUEST:  Nice to see you.  What happened at 12:00 during the day that  enabled the market to suddenly rise so sharply?</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, I'm not sure there was a specific event that caused  that day-end rally, but as you pointed out, people are growing more  comfortable with the notion that the Fed is going to stick with zero  percent interest rates for a couple more months, perhaps into early 2016.  </p><p>And while a few weeks ago, people complained about that, now I think  people are partying because it means more of the easy money flowing.</p><p>QUEST:  OK, so, we also had earnings results, which I'm just going to  remind.  Goldman Sachs had a third quarter miss, where net income fell.   But there was a concern particularly with Goldman Sachs -- the stock was  up, but it was about bond trading, wasn't it?  It was fixed income --</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  -- that was the cause of the problem.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes, the big drop there.  Fixed income, currencies,  commodities.</p><p>QUEST:  So, if Goldman was down on earnings and it misses, why is the  stock up 3 percent?</p><p>LA MONICA:  It's a great question.  There's a couple of things, I  think, at play.  One, people are hoping because the market has stabilized  since late August, that the worst of the turmoil is now over, fourth  quarter trading numbers should be better.</p><p>Also, Goldman's showing a lot more discipline.  Their compensation  expenses, the quote-unquote \"bonus pool,\" it's down 16 percent from a year  ago.  So, the company is not rewarding its employees as lavishly, because  times aren't as good.</p><p>QUEST:  One man who's not going to be rewarded as lavishly is  Christopher Bailey at Burberry.</p><p>LA MONICA:  Not at all.</p><p>QUEST:  Burberry's results -- \"It was an increasingly challenging  environment,\" is how they describe it.  But Burberry is related to China,  large numbers of sales in China, and that's down sharply.  Is this a bloody  nose, if you like, for Bailey?</p><p>LA MONICA:  I think it is.  China and Hong Kong are clearly a problem.   But he is not alone.  Every luxury retailer, and many retailers around the  world with exposure to China, are going to have difficult, at least for the  third quarter.  Again, will things stabilize in the fourth quarter?   Because Chinese stocks have surged as well so far this month.</p><p>QUEST:  I need to as you about debt.  I see -- I'm just looking at the  screen -- that the US government has announced basically that the federal  deficit was $439 billion in fiscal 15, which was $144 billion --</p><p>LA MONICA:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  -- less, giving a deficit of 2.5 percent.  That's remarkable  numbers.</p><p>[16:10:04]  LA MONICA:  It is.  I think what's really happening here  is that even though it's fashionable to complain about the sluggish growth  in the US economy, the US economy has grown steadily, even if it's not  spectacular, and you've seen that with the job market.  More people with  jobs equals more payroll taxes.  More revenue coming in, even though we're  still spending a lot, that leads to a lower deficit.</p><p>QUEST:  Even so, it means the deficit's not a problem.</p><p>LA MONICA:  No, of course the deficit is a problem for the long term.   We also have that debt ceiling debate, I mean --</p><p>QUEST:  Ah!  Leave the debt ceiling!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LA MONICA:  We are not out of the woods.</p><p>QUEST:  Leave the debt ceiling!</p><p>LA MONICA:  Washington is still a mess.</p><p>QUEST:  You said it, not me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST:  When we come back, a 90-day ban could have cost him his bid to  be the next FIFA president, and now it seems Michel Platini still has the  support of some very important allies.  It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS from New  York.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  UEFA is still backing its president to clear his name.  Michel  Platini's plans to become the next FIFA president were derailed when FIFA  banned him for allegedly taking a disloyal payment from Sepp Blatter.  Now,  he's won the unanimous support and backing from Europe's football  authorities.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIANNI INFANTINO, SECRETARY GENERAL, UEFA:  We support Michel  Platini's right to a due process and a fair trial and to the opportunity to  clear his name.  </p><p>We strongly call on all instances involved in the current process,  FIFA's ethics committee, FIFA's appeal committee and, ultimately, the court  of arbitration for sport, to work very rapidly to ensure that there is a  final decision on the merits of the case by, at the latest, mid-November  2015.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  Is Platini's aims and efforts derailed?  UEFA says it doesn't  want February's election for FIFA presidency to be delayed.  The problem  is, there aren't too many candidates left who aren't facing some form of  corruption or some allegation of misdeeds and miscreant behavior.</p><p>Now, Sepp Blatter has already been -- said he won't run.  The election  is because he said he's stepping down.  And anyway, he is suspended for 90  days.  Platini was one of the front-runners, but now he's also been  suspended for 90 days.</p><p>[16:15:05]  As for the Korean billionaire, Chung Mong-joon, he's been  banned for six years.  He was suspended over the bids for the next two  World Cups.  Which really just leaves us at the end with Prince Ali bin al- Hussein of Jordan, who lost to Blatter in the election this year.</p><p>You might -- and you would be perhaps reasonable if you say this lot  couldn't run the proverbial in a brewery.  Don Riddell is at the CNN Center  and joins me now.  Mr. Riddell, two of the three candidates are suspended.   I mean, how on Earth do they get out of this mess?</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, yes, that's the $64  million question, Richard.  I might perhaps have given Michel Platini a  yellow card, in your graphic there.  A red card would suggest that he's  completely out of the running.  </p><p>But you've heard that UEFA are going to give him their backing.  And  the way I understand that is, he's got our backing for now.  They want him  to go through the due process, where he has the opportunity to clear his  name, and they are insisting that that is done as quickly as possible, by  mid-November. </p><p>But it may well be that regardless of their backing, he can't run for  the presidency anyway, because he's submitted his paperwork, he's one of  only two men, he and Prince Ali, to have actually have got to that stage  with 11 days to go until the deadline --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>RIDDELL:  -- on October the 26th.  But he's still got to go through an  integrity check, and it may well be that FIFA determined he isn't fit to  run for the presidency anyway.</p><p>QUEST:  Now, can UEFA just ignore FIFA on this basis and say, let's  face it, you're all so corrupt, and it's such a shambles, that if we want  Platini to stay as head as UEFA, what are you going to do about it?  UEFA  is by far and away the biggest at the table.</p><p>RIDDELL:  Well, I mean, today's meeting was really to determine  whether or not Platini has their support for the FIFA presidency.  What  they were discussing today wasn't whether or not he's fit to be able to  continue on as the UEFA president.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>RIDDELL:  Incidentally, even though he's been banned from all  football-related activities for 90 days, UEFA said today that he's still  getting paid as the UEFA president.  So, it's easy to get mixed up in what  actually people are all talking about here.  But essentially, what was  going on today was whether or not UEFA --</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>RIDDELL:  -- supports Platini to run for the FIFA presidency.  And  right now, they do.  But as you say, there's only two men in the running,  and it's really hard to see how this process can go forward and take place  on February the 26th with any degree of credibility.</p><p>QUEST:  In a sentence, Don, are you still aghast at just how awful  this is?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RIDDELL:  None of this comes as any surprise anymore.  It's very  difficult to be shocked or surprised by any of this, Richard.  But it is an  absolute fiasco for sure.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  Don Riddell, thank you very much.  Our FIFA fiasco  correspondent, Don Riddell, bringing us up there.</p><p>Swiss watchmaker Hublot is a major FIFA sponsor.  Now, Hublot was the  official timekeeper of the 2014 World Cup.  As you can see.  And it will  reprise that role in 2018.  While many sponsors have either cut ties with  FIFA or called for Blatter to step down, Hublot has done neither.  </p><p>So now, we're going to give the head of Hublot, the chief exec, Jean- Claude Biver, the chance to actually say in clear terms, sir, what do you  think about the current fiasco with FIFA?  What do you want to happen?</p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE BIVER, CEO, HUBLOT:  I want the truth to come out.  I want  clarity.  I want to know what has happened.  For the time being, I can only  say there's a presumption of innocence.  At least in Europe, that's how I  think.</p><p>I want to know what has happened.  I want to -- I'm looking forward to  the 24th of November, when we will definitely know.  Now, for me, for our  brand --</p><p>QUEST:  It's damaging.</p><p>BIVER:  It's not damaging us.</p><p>QUEST:  Yet.</p><p>BIVER:  You know why?  Because we are part of the referee.  We hold  the referee board.  So, we are linked to the referees and to the game more,  somehow, than other sponsors, who are around the field.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.  So, I'm not going to dwell for long on this, because  we have other things to talk about, but to be clear, should Blatter go  sooner rather than later?</p><p>BIVER:  No.  He should go -- when he has to go.  Why should he go now?   If he goes now, means somehow he is guilty.  I mean, why should he go?  He  has a term, which is end of February, or something like that.  He should --  I mean, he's suspended.  So we're talking now -- he's out of there anymore.</p><p>[16:20:05]  QUEST:  Had you had had any moment had any doubts about  whether you should continue to sponsor --</p><p>BIVER: Never.  We didn't have a single doubt, because it will -- if  FIFA has a problem, it doesn't mean football has a problem.  And FIFA --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST:  But as FIFA's problem has continued, sponsors could have acted  sooner, could have put commercial pressure sooner.  Do you agree?</p><p>BIVER:  Eventually, yes, but there was no doubt that anything was  wrong.  I have been knowing Blatter since 40 years.  I cannot imagine today  that he did something wrong, voluntary.</p><p>QUEST:  You've announced a Tag Heuer sponsorship with Tom Brady.</p><p>BIVER:  Yes.</p><p>QUEST:  Which, of course, is a new venture.  I hesitate to suggest  Deflategate, but you do seem to have a knack for sponsoring people who  might have issues in the controversial area, don't you?</p><p>BIVER:  Yes.  We are disruptive.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BIVER:  Disruption is creativity.  The innovation disrupts the past.   And somehow, we believe in people, whatever is said on the right or on the  left side.  And by the way, Tom Brady is -- he was cleared and he is  totally innocent.</p><p>QUEST:  Well, the court has cleared him, yes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BIVER:  That's a lot.</p><p>QUEST:  Well, on appeal, it cleared him.  There's still the question  of well -- but you had no doubt with that either, with Brady?</p><p>BIVER:  I have no doubt with Brady.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes?</p><p>BIVER:  And I have no doubt -- I must say, it seems strange, I have no  doubt with Michel Platini, and I have no doubt with Blatter.</p><p>QUEST:  How much is this watch that I'm holding?</p><p>BIVER:  $5,000 US, or 5,000 Swiss francs.  Today, it's the same price.</p><p>QUEST:  Tell me!  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST:  I was in Geneva this morning!  I was in Geneva this morning.   How on Earth do people live in that city?  It's so expensive.</p><p>BIVER:  I think New York is more expensive for me than Geneva.  I had  a beer in the airport, a Budweiser, and I paid $6.  I said to myself, that  cannot be possible.  </p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST:  You're selling $5,000 watches.  You can afford it, sir.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST:  Right, let's just put this in a safe.  You won't be needing  this for the moment.  </p><p>There's a new front that we're going to be talking about with the  Freedom Project.  It follows in just a moment.

It was really something  that was very natural for us, because we are a training organization.  I  think first and foremost, it was developing a training that would make  sense for our team members.</p><p>SEBASTIAN:  Hilton now relies on a combination of this online training  and face-to-face classes.  Hotel staff are taught to look for possible red  flags and report them to the hotel manager, who will decide whether to  involve law enforcement.</p><p>CRAIG WILLIAMS, GENERAL MANAGER, HILTON NEWARK AIRPORT:  The Guest  Service agents will be looking for things like cash-paying guests, large  groups of young children.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera):  What are the room attendants -- what are the  cleaners looking for?</p><p>WILLIAMS:  Unusual situations in the room, alcohol, drugs.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  It's an uncomfortable reality for an industry  built on hospitality, holidays, happy times.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera):  And yet, signing ECPAT's code, like Hilton has  done, is not the only way that this industry is tackling this darker side.   Some companies, for example, have their own specific policies.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over):  Companies like Starwood Hotels and American  Airlines have implemented training programs of their own.

Why has tech had such a bad  rap in IPOs, bearing in mind to a man, woman and child, we agree tech is  the future?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT:  Well, what happened is you  had a lot of the big tech companies - Facebook, Twitter - and they came out  and they had great IPOs - Twitter at first, not so much anymore for their  stuff.</p><p>But what a lot of companies saw was these great sexy IPOs and they  wanted to follow in their footsteps.  But by the time they reached the  market, they already had a lot of competitors and so it hasn't gone quite  as well for them.</p><p>And when it comes to Square, Richard, we've learned a lot.  They earn  a lot of money, they spend a lot of money, but at the end of the day,  they're still not profitable.</p><p>Just take a look at these numbers, Richard.  Revenue is up for Square  54 percent to $850 million.  Losses increased to $154 million though.  Most  surprising of all, their deal to process Starbucks has actually caused them  to lose $28 million.  </p><p>But at the end of the day, I'll get back to your question.  Here we  see razor-thin margins and a very competitive field --</p><p>QUEST:  Right, but - </p><p>BURKE:  -- the same thing that has hurt the other IPOs.</p><p>QUEST:  The difference though with something like Square and it's  always a risk of newer technology or a better mousetrap, but at least  they're making a product which is clearly in demand.  They've got  competitors unlike some companies which are just mist on the waters.</p><p>BURKE:  That's right, and that's part of the reason that they want to  do their IPO.  And they know they've got the revenue coming in, they need  the money to continue to attract new clients.</p><p>But another reason that they want to do it - because they just want to  stay ahead of the competition.  A lot of people recognize that if Square  doesn't act now, those competitors are going to get the best of them.</p><p>And yes, there's a lull but a lot of people are expecting big numbers  for those other companies and it shows.</p><p>QUEST:  So, I know Square obviously warned about Dorsey spending time  between Square and Twitter.  How much of that is a real concern?  Because  new companies - I mean, most companies - shouldn't just be completely  dependent on the chief executive. </p><p>But new companies tend to be more reliant on the ability of the CEO.</p><p>BURKE:  And this is uncharted territory.  It's very rare to see the  CEO of two companies of this size in charge - Jack Dorsey in charge of  Twitter, Jack Dorsey in charge of Square.</p><p>Take a look at this little nugget that I found in there prospectus,  and it took some people by surprise because Jack Dorsey has been so  confident.  He said -- or rather in the prospectus for Square - they say  quote, \"This may at times adversely affect his ability {Jack Dorsey's  ability}to devote time, attention and effort to Square.  </p><p>Now, when I talked to Jack Dorsey about his last year, he said,  listen, they're right next door to each other, I can easily cross the  street and go from one to another.</p><p>He makes it sound almost as easy as you, Richard, going from one show  to another - \"Business Traveler\" to \"Quest Means Business,\" but it might be  a little bit tougher than that.  At least that's what some of the investors  are thinking.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes, I mean, many CEOs run much bigger companies than those  two and manage to do so successfully.  Dorsey can do it.  (RINGS BELL).   Thank you, Samuel Burke in London.  </p><p>Coming soon to a stock exchange near you, an IMAX IPO in Hong Kong  that's been a blockbuster success.

We filed in around April or May.   I was there in June for kind of pre-IPO meetings and I felt like the  hottest commodity in town.  I had 61 meetings and people were like how much  can I buy, how fast?</p><p>And then we had planned on going right around Labor Day, and the  markets had been really volatile and as you know they devalued the ranum be  (ph) and the market hit its lowest point in two years.  </p><p>And sure I was worried.  I mean, you know, you could not be worried.  </p><p>QUEST:  So why didn't you pull it?  Because we've seen cases - I  remember WizzAir in London literally pulled their IPO within days of when  it was supposed to happen.  Why did you decide not do that?</p><p>GELFOND:  Because we were going to own 70 percent of it after the IPO  happened and we were only selling 7 percent in the IPO.</p><p>So I wasn't so concerned about what the price was in the IPO as I was  about where it traded in the aftermarket so we could create long-term value  which is why we did it.</p><p>So I view windows as either opened or closed and, you know, I didn't  need the last nickel and it made sense for me to wait a while to see if we  could sneak through.</p><p>And the Fed didn't raise interest rates as you know at the end of  September and we found a window.</p><p>QUEST:  This is fascinating because I'm getting real insight into the  sort of decisions you have to make and we often don't hear about in terms  of an IPO.</p><p>In the days after and the week after, we've seen this 35 percent rise  in the level.  What's driving that?  Is it speculation or is it  fundamental?</p><p>GELFOND:  I think it's more fundamental.  I think one reason that it  was priced lower than it could have been is where investors were just  skittish about IPOs in general.</p><p>[16:45:04] QUEST:  But that really - but that meant leaving some money  on the table.</p><p>GELFOND:  That meant leaving money on the table, but our book was very  strong.  We were more than five times oversubscribed and remember this is  discretionary consumer in China.</p><p>This isn't export, this isn't manufacturing, and that segment has done  extremely well, Richard.  So I felt good about it.  </p><p>There's a lot of demand, the road shows were full, and I think the  bankers who did a good job priced it deliberately a little lower so it  would trade well.  </p><p>QUEST:  And what did you do with the money?</p><p>GELFOND:  Some of the money is going to be reinvested in China and  we're going to build a post-production facility, a screening room, invest  in more theater deals in China, more joint ventures.</p><p>And then the amount we sell - the amount we sold - we're going to keep  on our balance sheet to do better things.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you, sir, I appreciate it.</p><p>GELFOND:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much indeed.  Now from the small screen - from  the big screen and the small screen - to the very small screen.</p><p>GoPro is used for all sorts of extreme sports and GoPro shares have  been on an extreme downhill slide.  GoPro's fallen more than 50 percent  this year.</p><p>The company does have ambitions to get some uplift - it's taking on  the drone market.  And its chief exec Nick Woodman told Maggie Lake that  the company plans to roll out its own version of (GESTURES) next year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>NICK WOODMAN, CEO, GOPRO:  We definitely are on track to introduce our  drone for the first half of 2016, and we're really excited about it.  </p><p>And it's going to be a differentiated experience that I think is going  to be extremely well received by GoPro existing and new customers.</p><p>Even though we don't yet have a drone product in the market, I think  GoPro has been such a big part of why consumers are so interested in drones  and in other flying camera solutions -- because the drone market really  took off when people started mounting GoPros specifically on drones.</p><p>A lot of the drones that are flying, they already are GoPros in a  sense, and so I think that that gives us a distinct advantage against say  another company that was entering the market that had no history in that  space whatsoever.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST:  GoPro in the market and Rich Gelfond pulling us right in terms  of the price at which his IPO.  It was fascinating actually to hear an IPO  - to hear a CEO - talk about an IPO, something they're often frequently  reluctant to do so.</p><p>Here in the United States you are expected to tip on just about  everything.  Now a campaign has begun to curb the tipping activity.   There's a major boost to the anti-tipping movement.  @RichardQuest on your  thoughts of what you think about tipping.</p><p>We're going to talk about it after you've watched a highlight from  \"Make, Create, Innovate.\"  (RINGS BELL).</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:50:43] QUEST:  Welcome to the restaurant.  You are most welcome.   And now one of New York's top restauranteurs has joined the no-tipping  movement.  </p><p>Danny Meyer's banning the practice at his full-service restaurants  starting late next month.  It's a major change for New Yorkers.  Indeed,  tipping is pretty much engrained in this society.</p><p>For instance, look at what TripAdvisor says, \"Tipping is a part of our  service economy and our taxation system, and all visitors should understand  that it is part of our local culture.\"  </p><p>Is it really?  Joining me now to talk about this is Drew Neiporent,  the owner of Myriad Restaurant  Group.  Good to see you, sir.</p><p>DREW NIEPORENT, OWNER, MYRIAD RESTAURANT GROUP:  Likewise.  Did you  leave a tip the last time you were at Nobu?</p><p>QUEST:  The bill - </p><p>NIEPORENT:  Maybe not because in London it's value added, right?  And  it's 12 points price (ph) -</p><p>QUEST:  No, no - you still -- there's still a tip -- a line for the  tip you can always add in.  But here's the point, here's the point - are  you going to follow Meyer and other's lead in this regard or are you just  thinking about whether you should?</p><p>NIEPORENT:  No, we've though this - you know - Danny and I actually  came up together in 1985 at a restaurant called Mon Triche (ph).  They  still have Trifecta Grill and Nobu for over 25 years.  No, but whatever.</p><p>Danny's a terrific person and perhaps this works for his group.   Economics of the restaurant business are miserable, Richard.  They just  don't work.  </p><p>And the tipping equation is part of American culture, and it might  work for Danny Meyer, but it doesn't work for the vast majority of  restaurants in this country.</p><p>QUEST:  But the problem  is not tipping per se because, you know,  wherever you travel in the world you leave a tip on the restaurant.</p><p>It's got out of control in the United States some people would say.   This idea of a 20 percent tip - on a meal that was probably quite expensive  to start with.</p><p>NIEPORENT:  But, Richard, let me tell you.  These are hardworking  people and, you know, this is a complicated issue.  I would acknowledge  that.</p><p>QUEST:  Yes.</p><p>NIEPORENT:  But to just go to the extreme.  You're not a stupid person  - if you're leaving 20 percent on $100, that's $20.  Danny Meyer's going to  charge you 30 percent more on the prices.  </p><p>So he's looking at you and he's saying, you know what, you don't have  to leave a tip.  But he's banging you for another 30 percent, not 20  percent.  And that is where the problem lies.</p><p>He's not doing you any favors.</p><p>QUEST:  I wonder though when you talk about this, I've always had the  feeling that you're transferring your wage bill to me.</p><p>NIEPORENT:  OK that's - but everything is transferred to you.  You're  the customer.  Everything that we charge based - is based on - us being  able to meet our expenses to be able to stay in business.  </p><p>And you're looking at somebody who's opened over 40 restaurants in the  last 30 years, all around the world including in the communist country  known as California - </p><p>QUEST:  Right.  </p><p>NIEPORENT:  And where I did pay wages of $10 per hour, and guess what?   Everyone got paid except for us, the investors.  </p><p>QUEST:  So would you be in favor or do you believe that tipping should  be withheld in the case of bad service?  Unlike as it (AUDIO GAP) somebody  run down the street after me saying you didn't leave me a big enough tip.  </p><p>We've all heard those stories.  But - </p><p>NIEPORENT:  As long as they didn't do anything to your food while you  were still there.  But the answer is - </p><p>QUEST:  (LAUGHTER).  </p><p>NIEPORENT:  -- of course, Richard, you're allowed - you're the guest.</p><p>QUEST:  Right.</p><p>NIEPORENT:  And if you don't receive commensurate service, you're  entitled to leave whatever you desire which includes zero.</p><p>But the truth is, is that we're in a service business and these people  work hard and they deserve that 15 or 20 percent that you've been leaving -  that millions of people tonight will leave in restaurants in New York City.</p><p>QUEST:  Do you think the law should be changed in the United States so  that tips can be shared?  Tips coming through to the front - </p><p>NIEPORENT:  Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST:  -- because many people don't realize that tips given to  waiters or the waiting staff cannot be shared by federal law with those  back of house.  </p><p>NIEPORENT:  Absolutely, because the generation that you're looking at  in Danny Meyer, what we did want to try to do when we first came up was  make the system equitable.  </p><p>And that would have been to take gratuities and share them equitably  with our entire staff.  And then we got kicked in the teeth because there  were lawsuit after lawsuit - basically ambulance-chasing attorneys.  None  of these things got adjudicated in law, we all have to settle because you  know how lawyers can be.</p><p>And anyway, the bottom line is, yes, without a question the law should  be changed about the distribution of gratuities.</p><p>[16:55:05] QUEST:  I wish I had a glass to say cheers.</p><p>NIEPORENT:  I was about to say, this is the only time I had never been  offered a glass of wine (LAUGHTER).  Thank you, Richard, you're tremendous  at what you do.</p><p>QUEST:  Next time in your restaurant. </p><p>NIEPORENT:  I hope so.  Thank you very much.</p><p>QUEST:  Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>NIEPORENT:  Thank you.</p><p>QUEST:  We will have a \"Profitable Moment\" after the break.  </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>QUEST:  Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\"  Claire Sebastian brought us a  report this evening that showed how the hospitality industry is dealing  with the very serious question of child sex trafficking.  </p><p>It's gratifying to see that an industry which so often wants to look  in the opposite direction is finally admitting that there is a problem and  they're going to do something about it.</p><p>The World Tourism Organization has for a long time made it clear that  things have to change. And if you ever try and get a tourist company to  talk about something as serious as this, well they just push it to one  side.  </p><p>It's the nasty side of tourism that nobody ever wants to face up to.  </p><p>Thankfully people like Hilton, Marriott, the big airlines are now  saying that they will not shove this aside.  They will acknowledge there's  a problem and they will do something about it.</p><p>There's absolutely no room in any form of an industry for the sort of  industry - child sex tourism - that has been taking place.  And the  gratification that now those companies are doing something about it must be  celebrated.</p><p>And that is \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight.  I'm Richard Quest  back in New York.  Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, (RINGS BELL) I  hope it's profitable.  We'll do it again tomorrow.  </p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and programming copyright 2015 Cable News Network, Inc.

The VW scandal has been so dramatic that Leonard DiCaprio has already bought the film rights to a Volkswagen book, even though the author, Jack Ewing, hasn't written the book yet. The latest recall news sent Volkswagen stock plummeting in Germany, but the rest of the markets had a good day in Europe. US stocks rose all day, including a large rally in the afternoon, sending the Dow back over 17,000 again. Goldman Sachsand Burberry both miss in third quarter earnings. The US government has announced that the federal deficit was $439 billion in fiscal 15, which was $144 billion less, giving a deficit of 2.5 percent. Michel Platini's plans to become the next FIFA president were derailed when FIFA banned him for allegedly taking a disloyal payment from Sepp Blatter, but now he's won the unanimous backing from Europe's football authorities. The CEO of Swiss watchmaker Hublot, one of the major sponsors of FIFA, shares his thoughts on the FIFA scandal. Hublot also announces a Tag Heuer sponsorship with <person><nameText>Tom Brady </nameText></person>despite the Deflategate scandal. Interpol and Europol are taking on the organized criminals who are fueling the migrant crisis in a coordinated action to stop the human traffickers and the people smugglers who are trading in human misery. A third of all victims of human trafficking are children, according to the United Nations, and it is happening in the United States behind locked hotel room doors, so the travel industry is being warned to look out for signs of abuse.

Look at how the graph goes up as the market rose from 12:00 onwards, with a strong one and a third percent gain at the end of the session. And the man at the --</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(GAVEL POUNDS)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QUEST: Ooh. That is what you call a wimpy gavel on Thursday, October the 15th.</p><p>Back it into the garage. Germany orders a massive recall of Volkswagen cars.</p><p>It's a square offering in a market that's gone pear-shaped.</p><p>And think of it as the tipping point, as one restaurateur takes the power to tip out of your hands.</p><p>I'm Richard Quest, back in New York, where of course I mean business.</p><p>Good evening. Tonight, the wheels are set in motion on Volkswagen's giant recall. The company has announced one of the biggest recalls in auto history. It's trying to rectify the cars that cheat on emissions tests.</p><p>You'll remember originally Volkswagen had hoped to do it as a voluntary recall, and they weren't even using the word \"recall.\" Well, no longer. Now the company is to recall 8.5 million diesel vehicles. The work will begin in January, and VW says there'll be no cost to the customer. That's generous of them.</p><p>It comes after German regulators ordered a mandatory recall of a couple of million cars. Germany's transport minister said Volkswagen had no choice. They had to get the cars off the road.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ALEXANDER DORBRINDT, GERMAN TRANSPORT MINISTER (through translator): The KBA believes this to be a case of software using an unreliable defeat device. VW must now remove the corresponding software from all vehicles and take the necessary steps to ensure compliance with emission regulations.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: This latest recall only makes the emissions scandal go deeper and more expensive for Volkswagen. The events of the past month have been so dramatic that Leonard DiCaprio has already bought the film rights to a Volkswagen book, even though the author, Jack Ewing, hasn't written the book yet. We'll talk about that with the author in a moment. But all the twists and turns have inspired us to give VW the Hollywood treatment.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MICHAEL HORN, PRESIDENT AND CEO, VOLKSWAGEN GROUP OF AMERICA: In my German words, we've totally screwed up.</p><p>MARTIN WINTERKORN, CEO, VOLKSWAGEN (through translator): The irregularities in our group's diesel engines go against everything Volkswagen stands for.</p><p>LAUREN FIX, CAR COACH: This is a very serious situation because it's a trust issue issue more than anything.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There can be no winking, no blinking on how you meet regulations around the globe.</p><p>REP. JOE BARTON (R), TEXAS: Do you really believe that senior-level corporate managers had no knowledge for years and years?</p><p>HORN: I agree it's very hard to believe.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: I'd go and watch that movie. The question is, is it the book that Jack Ewing of the \"New York Times\" is going to write? Joins me now. Sir. So, you're writing the book, and I know that's what you're here to talk about. Tell me why did you decide to do it?</p><p>JACK EWING, EUROPEAN ECONOMICS COMMENTATOR, \"NEW YORK TIMES\": Well, to be quite honest, a publisher approached me, Norton, and asked me if I would be interested in doing it. That was only about three weeks ago, and things have moved very quickly since then. I have a great agent, Marly Rusoff, who took it to Hollywood, and you know the rest.</p><p>QUEST: Are you surprised at the speed at which this has happened?</p><p>EWING: Yes, very -- you mean in terms of it going to Hollywood?</p><p>QUEST: The whole process. Well, let's face it, this scandal, I mean, although those involved have been negotiating it for a year or two, the rest of the world -- the rest of us have only known about it for the last couple of months.</p><p>EWING: Yes. No, the way it hit was amazing. It's -- one day we found out there was the cheating, and then just an incredible amount of stuff has happened since, that it's totally turned Volkswagen upside-down.</p><p>QUEST: We'll leave the movie to one side, but in terms of the book, what do you aim for the book to do? What do you want it to discover?</p><p>EWING: Well, I think there's two goals. One, I just want to tell the story, and I -- the big question that everybody wants to know is, who is responsible for this inside Volkswagen? What kind of management mistakes allowed this to happen? I think that's one part of the story.</p><p>And then, I'm also looking at the broader issue of what this means for businesses in general? What does this say about the way businesses operate today?</p><p>QUEST: Let's talk on that issue, because when I heard it, initially you thought, well, this can't be true. I mean, it's so outrageous. And then you heard the testimony last -- two weeks ago in front of Congress, where basically, they lied. And now we're hearing that there may have been dozens of engineers in Volkswagen who knew about this.</p><p>EWING: Yes, well, it's hard to believe that something that was installed in 11 million cars, that that was the work of a very small group of people. There had to be a number of people involved.</p><p>[16:05:02] And I think that's what we still don't know, is how far did this go? How high did it go? And why did Volkswagen not have systems in place that would prevent this type of problem from reaching a point where it could really threaten the entire company?</p><p>QUEST: When I look at BP and Macondo and the Gulf of Mexico, there was an incident, and there was no real -- there were certain cultural problems that allowed it to happen, but the company had to move quickly to protect the balance sheet, selling off assets and all that sort of thing.</p><p>Do you expect the same sort of actions now from Volkswagen? We know they've already cut capex. But what more do you think Volkswagen will have to do?</p><p>EWING: I think they'll wait as long as they can before they start selling off unites, like Lamborghini or Bentley, some of those, some of the family silver, so to speak. But I think the main effect that is it's going to hurt their ability to invest in new technologies.</p><p>QUEST: And finally, is the book going to be sexy, and who's going to play the leading role?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: You knew I was going to ask you that.</p><p>EWING: Sexy? I don't know, I don't have any sex scenes yet, and that might be a little hard to come up with. Leading roles? I think DiCaprio would make a great Martin Winterkorn, but that's up to him. I have no idea what he's planning to do.</p><p>QUEST: Martin Winterkorn, Leonardo DiCaprio. I'll come to the opening night. Thank you very much.</p><p>EWING: Great, Richard.</p><p>QUEST: Good to see you. Now, the latest recall news sent Volkswagen stock plummeting in Germany. Join me at the super screens, and you'll see how the markets traded. Which -- when you think of what happened to Volkswagen and put it into the context of the other markets, you'll see.</p><p>Take, say, for example the Xetra DAX. This was how the one day trading, you have that very sharp fall there, reflecting it. The markets had a good day in Europe, except, obviously, for certain stocks. The Xetra DAX was up 1.5 percent.</p><p>Just show you how it's gone over the last six months. That's, obviously, the crisis over the last few weeks. The FTSE was also up more than 1 percent. Paris and -- similarly, they were all up.</p><p>There was weak US data, which suggested interest rates will not rise this year. In fact, there's been a whole slew of economic data suggesting now that interest rates won't rise despite what Janet Yellen said in a recent speech.</p><p>Two members of the Fed Board -- the FOMC -- are now believed to believe that it should be pushed into next month, so dissension within the Fed is starting to become a real issue.</p><p>From here onwards, 12:00 onwards, and the market goes on an absolute tear, back over 17,000. But what happened this afternoon? What happened this afternoon that caused all this to take place? We'll talk about that as we also talk about earnings with Paul La Monica. Good to see you, Paul.</p><p>PAUL LA MONICA, CNN MONEY DIGITAL CORRESPONDENT: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Nice to see you. What happened at 12:00 during the day that enabled the market to suddenly rise so sharply?</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, I'm not sure there was a specific event that caused that day-end rally, but as you pointed out, people are growing more comfortable with the notion that the Fed is going to stick with zero percent interest rates for a couple more months, perhaps into early 2016.</p><p>And while a few weeks ago, people complained about that, now I think people are partying because it means more of the easy money flowing.</p><p>QUEST: OK, so, we also had earnings results, which I'm just going to remind. Goldman Sachshad a third quarter miss, where net income fell. But there was a concern particularly with Goldman Sachs-- the stock was up, but it was about bond trading, wasn't it? It was fixed income --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- that was the cause of the problem.</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes, the big drop there. Fixed income, currencies, commodities.</p><p>QUEST: So, if Goldman was down on earnings and it misses, why is the stock up 3 percent?</p><p>LA MONICA: It's a great question. There's a couple of things, I think, at play. One, people are hoping because the market has stabilized since late August, that the worst of the turmoil is now over, fourth quarter trading numbers should be better.</p><p>Also, Goldman's showing a lot more discipline. Their compensation expenses, the quote-unquote \"bonus pool,\" it's down 16 percent from a year ago. So, the company is not rewarding its employees as lavishly, because times aren't as good.</p><p>QUEST: One man who's not going to be rewarded as lavishly is Christopher Bailey at Burberry.</p><p>LA MONICA: Not at all.</p><p>QUEST: Burberry's results -- \"It was an increasingly challenging environment,\" is how they describe it. But Burberry is related to China, large numbers of sales in China, and that's down sharply. Is this a bloody nose, if you like, for Bailey?</p><p>LA MONICA: I think it is. China and Hong Kong are clearly a problem. But he is not alone. Every luxury retailer, and many retailers around the world with exposure to China, are going to have difficult, at least for the third quarter. Again, will things stabilize in the fourth quarter? Because Chinese stocks have surged as well so far this month.</p><p>QUEST: I need to as you about debt. I see -- I'm just looking at the screen -- that the US government has announced basically that the federal deficit was $439 billion in fiscal 15, which was $144 billion --</p><p>LA MONICA: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: -- less, giving a deficit of 2.5 percent. That's remarkable numbers.</p><p>[16:10:04] LA MONICA: It is. I think what's really happening here is that even though it's fashionable to complain about the sluggish growth in the US economy, the US economy has grown steadily, even if it's not spectacular, and you've seen that with the job market. More people with jobs equals more payroll taxes. More revenue coming in, even though we're still spending a lot, that leads to a lower deficit.</p><p>QUEST: Even so, it means the deficit's not a problem.</p><p>LA MONICA: No, of course the deficit is a problem for the long term. We also have that debt ceiling debate, I mean --</p><p>QUEST: Ah! Leave the debt ceiling!</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>LA MONICA: We are not out of the woods.</p><p>QUEST: Leave the debt ceiling!</p><p>LA MONICA: Washington is still a mess.</p><p>QUEST: You said it, not me.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: When we come back, a 90-day ban could have cost him his bid to be the next FIFA president, and now it seems Michel Platini still has the support of some very important allies. It's QUEST MEANS BUSINESS from New York.</p><p>(RINGS BELL)</p><p>QUEST: UEFA is still backing its president to clear his name. Michel Platini's plans to become the next FIFA president were derailed when FIFA banned him for allegedly taking a disloyal payment from Sepp Blatter. Now, he's won the unanimous support and backing from Europe's football authorities.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GIANNI INFANTINO, SECRETARY GENERAL, UEFA: We support Michel Platini's right to a due process and a fair trial and to the opportunity to clear his name.</p><p>We strongly call on all instances involved in the current process, FIFA's ethics committee, FIFA's appeal committee and, ultimately, the court of arbitration for sport, to work very rapidly to ensure that there is a final decision on the merits of the case by, at the latest, mid-November 2015.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>QUEST: Is Platini's aims and efforts derailed? UEFA says it doesn't want February's election for FIFA presidency to be delayed. The problem is, there aren't too many candidates left who aren't facing some form of corruption or some allegation of misdeeds and miscreant behavior.</p><p>Now, Sepp Blatter has already been -- said he won't run. The election is because he said he's stepping down. And anyway, he is suspended for 90 days. Platini was one of the front-runners, but now he's also been suspended for 90 days.</p><p>[16:15:05] As for the Korean billionaire, Chung Mong-joon, he's been banned for six years. He was suspended over the bids for the next two World Cups. Which really just leaves us at the end with Prince Ali bin al- Hussein of Jordan, who lost to Blatter in the election this year.</p><p>You might -- and you would be perhaps reasonable if you say this lot couldn't run the proverbial in a brewery. Don Riddell is at the CNN Center and joins me now. Mr. Riddell, two of the three candidates are suspended. I mean, how on Earth do they get out of this mess?</p><p>DON RIDDELL, CNN SPORTS CORRESPONDENT: Well, yes, that's the $64 million question, Richard. I might perhaps have given Michel Platini a yellow card, in your graphic there. A red card would suggest that he's completely out of the running.</p><p>But you've heard that UEFA are going to give him their backing. And the way I understand that is, he's got our backing for now. They want him to go through the due process, where he has the opportunity to clear his name, and they are insisting that that is done as quickly as possible, by mid-November.</p><p>But it may well be that regardless of their backing, he can't run for the presidency anyway, because he's submitted his paperwork, he's one of only two men, he and Prince Ali, to have actually have got to that stage with 11 days to go until the deadline --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RIDDELL: -- on October the 26th. But he's still got to go through an integrity check, and it may well be that FIFA determined he isn't fit to run for the presidency anyway.</p><p>QUEST: Now, can UEFA just ignore FIFA on this basis and say, let's face it, you're all so corrupt, and it's such a shambles, that if we want Platini to stay as head as UEFA, what are you going to do about it? UEFA is by far and away the biggest at the table.</p><p>RIDDELL: Well, I mean, today's meeting was really to determine whether or not Platini has their support for the FIFA presidency. What they were discussing today wasn't whether or not he's fit to be able to continue on as the UEFA president.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RIDDELL: Incidentally, even though he's been banned from all football-related activities for 90 days, UEFA said today that he's still getting paid as the UEFA president. So, it's easy to get mixed up in what actually people are all talking about here. But essentially, what was going on today was whether or not UEFA --</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>RIDDELL: -- supports Platini to run for the FIFA presidency. And right now, they do. But as you say, there's only two men in the running, and it's really hard to see how this process can go forward and take place on February the 26th with any degree of credibility.</p><p>QUEST: In a sentence, Don, are you still aghast at just how awful this is?</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>RIDDELL: None of this comes as any surprise anymore. It's very difficult to be shocked or surprised by any of this, Richard. But it is an absolute fiasco for sure.</p><p>QUEST: Right. Don Riddell, thank you very much. Our FIFA fiasco correspondent, Don Riddell, bringing us up there.</p><p>Swiss watchmaker Hublot is a major FIFA sponsor. Now, Hublot was the official timekeeper of the 2014 World Cup. As you can see. And it will reprise that role in 2018. While many sponsors have either cut ties with FIFA or called for Blatter to step down, Hublot has done neither.</p><p>So now, we're going to give the head of Hublot, the chief exec, Jean- Claude Biver, the chance to actually say in clear terms, sir, what do you think about the current fiasco with FIFA? What do you want to happen?</p><p>JEAN-CLAUDE BIVER, CEO, HUBLOT: I want the truth to come out. I want clarity. I want to know what has happened. For the time being, I can only say there's a presumption of innocence. At least in Europe, that's how I think.</p><p>I want to know what has happened. I want to -- I'm looking forward to the 24th of November, when we will definitely know. Now, for me, for our brand --</p><p>QUEST: It's damaging.</p><p>BIVER: It's not damaging us.</p><p>QUEST: Yet.</p><p>BIVER: You know why? Because we are part of the referee. We hold the referee board. So, we are linked to the referees and to the game more, somehow, than other sponsors, who are around the field.</p><p>QUEST: Right. So, I'm not going to dwell for long on this, because we have other things to talk about, but to be clear, should Blatter go sooner rather than later?</p><p>BIVER: No. He should go -- when he has to go. Why should he go now? If he goes now, means somehow he is guilty. I mean, why should he go? He has a term, which is end of February, or something like that. He should -- I mean, he's suspended. So we're talking now -- he's out of there anymore.</p><p>[16:20:05] QUEST: Had you had had any moment had any doubts about whether you should continue to sponsor --</p><p>BIVER: Never. We didn't have a single doubt, because it will -- if FIFA has a problem, it doesn't mean football has a problem. And FIFA --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>QUEST: But as FIFA's problem has continued, sponsors could have acted sooner, could have put commercial pressure sooner. Do you agree?</p><p>BIVER: Eventually, yes, but there was no doubt that anything was wrong. I have been knowing Blatter since 40 years. I cannot imagine today that he did something wrong, voluntary.</p><p>QUEST: You've announced a Tag Heuer sponsorship with <person><nameText>Tom Brady.</nameText></person></p><p>BIVER: Yes.</p><p>QUEST: Which, of course, is a new venture. I hesitate to suggest Deflategate, but you do seem to have a knack for sponsoring people who might have issues in the controversial area, don't you?</p><p>BIVER: Yes. We are disruptive.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>BIVER: Disruption is creativity. The innovation disrupts the past. And somehow, we believe in people, whatever is said on the right or on the left side. And by the way, <person><nameText>Tom Brady </nameText></person>is -- he was cleared and he is totally innocent.</p><p>QUEST: Well, the court has cleared him, yes --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>BIVER: That's a lot.</p><p>QUEST: Well, on appeal, it cleared him. There's still the question of well -- but you had no doubt with that either, with Brady?</p><p>BIVER: I have no doubt with Brady.</p><p>QUEST: Yes?</p><p>BIVER: And I have no doubt -- I must say, it seems strange, I have no doubt with Michel Platini, and I have no doubt with Blatter.</p><p>QUEST: How much is this watch that I'm holding?</p><p>BIVER: $5,000 US, or 5,000 Swiss francs. Today, it's the same price.</p><p>QUEST: Tell me!</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: I was in Geneva this morning! I was in Geneva this morning. How on Earth do people live in that city? It's so expensive.</p><p>BIVER: I think New York is more expensive for me than Geneva. I had a beer in the airport, a Budweiser, and I paid $6. I said to myself, that cannot be possible.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: You're selling $5,000 watches. You can afford it, sir.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>QUEST: Right, let's just put this in a safe. You won't be needing this for the moment.</p><p>There's a new front that we're going to be talking about with the Freedom Project. It follows in just a moment. Our agenda turns in a very difficult and different direction. We're going to be talking about what happens in hotels all around the world. The Freedom Project on the front lines.</p><p>[16:25:25] QUEST: Interpol and Europol are taking on the organized criminals who are fueling the migrant crisis. They want a coordinated action to stop the human traffickers and the people smugglers who are trading in human misery.</p><p>The law enforcement agencies -- now it's going to hold a two-day meeting at Interpol's headquarters in southern France. And there, they'll discuss how to disrupt these criminal networks. There'll be representatives from 50 countries who'll take part.</p><p>As you may know, a third of all victims of human trafficking are children, according to the United Nations, and it is happening right here in the United States behind locked hotel room doors. The travel industry is being warned to look out for signs of abuse. CNN's Clare Sebastian exposes a problem, which literally could be happening across the corridor.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: On a ran of the hotel, the guy at the front desk looked at me. I feel like he knew something was wrong.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN PRODUCER (voice-over): This is the latest campaign by anti-child trafficking group, ECPAT-USA, to spur the travel industry into action.</p><p>CAROL SMOKENSKI, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, ECPAT-USA: The fact is that children are commercially, sexually exploited at hotels in the United States. It happens all over. It's not like there's one bad company or one bad place. Frankly, pimps and traffickers don't really car.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: The card now has more than 1200 signatories worldwide. At last count, 223 are full members, who report to ECPAT every year. Hilton became a member in 2011.</p><p>JENNIFER SILBERMAN, SENIOR MANAGER, HILTON WORLDWIDE: Infusing this into our overall training agenda or curriculum. It was really something that was very natural for us, because we are a training organization. I think first and foremost, it was developing a training that would make sense for our team members.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Hilton now relies on a combination of this online training and face-to-face classes. Hotel staff are taught to look for possible red flags and report them to the hotel manager, who will decide whether to involve law enforcement.</p><p>CRAIG WILLIAMS, GENERAL MANAGER, HILTON NEWARK AIRPORT: The Guest Service agents will be looking for things like cash-paying guests, large groups of young children.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): What are the room attendants -- what are the cleaners looking for?</p><p>WILLIAMS: Unusual situations in the room, alcohol, drugs.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): It's an uncomfortable reality for an industry built on hospitality, holidays, happy times.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (on camera): And yet, signing ECPAT's code, like Hilton has done, is not the only way that this industry is tackling this darker side. Some companies, for example, have their own specific policies.</p><p>SEBASTIAN (voice-over): Companies like Starwood Hotels and American Airlines have implemented training programs of their own. There are also other NGOs, like Airline Ambassadors, an ECPAT signatory, which trains airport and airline staff in the US.</p><p>And there's raising public awareness. Marriott International is a major sponsor of the UN's Be a Responsible Traveler program. All these efforts are helping break the taboo that once surrounded this issue.</p><p>WILLIAMS: In the three, four years that this has been exposed to me and my hotel team, we've come a very long way. It's a subject that is talked about often.</p><p>SEBASTIAN: With more than a billion people traveling abroad each year, this industry is more engaged than ever in the fight against human trafficking.</p><p>Clare Sebastian, CNN, New York.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>QUEST: An important point, and I'll talk more about that in the Profitable Moment at the end of the program. QUEST MEANS BUSINESS returns in a second or two.</p><p>[16:29:00] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>[16:32:16] QUEST: Hello, I'm Richard Quest.

The mobile payments company says it's applying to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticket symbol SQ. Those are my mother's initials.</p><p>Anyway, no word yet on the number of shares or indeed the price range. Square launched in 2009. It's now valued at $6 billion.</p><p>Why to go public now for a tech company is a serious question investors may want to know.</p><p>There've been just 17 tech IPOs in 2015 which is the lowest number since 2009. And when you look at the performance, they are some of the worst that we've seen in the second quarter.</p><p>For instance, (RINGS BELL) Etsy down 63 percent since an April debut, Box down 46 percent since the debut in January.</p><p>Alibaba, GoPro, GrubHub - they were all sharply down over the course of the year. Now amongst those still waiting in the wings - Airbnb, SnapChat and Uber.</p><p>Uber will be amongst one of the most valuable companies in the world if it goes according to plan.</p><p>More tech startups opted for private funding. It's away from the market and you're less likely to suffer the effects.</p><p>Samuel Burke joins me now from London. Why has tech had such a bad rap in IPOs, bearing in mind to a man, woman and child, we agree tech is the future?</p><p>SAMUEL BURKE, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Well, what happened is you had a lot of the big tech companies - Facebook, Twitter - and they came out and they had great IPOs - Twitter at first, not so much anymore for their stuff.</p><p>But what a lot of companies saw was these great sexy IPOs and they wanted to follow in their footsteps. But by the time they reached the market, they already had a lot of competitors and so it hasn't gone quite as well for them.</p><p>And when it comes to Square, Richard, we've learned a lot. They earn a lot of money, they spend a lot of money, but at the end of the day, they're still not profitable.</p><p>Just take a look at these numbers, Richard. Revenue is up for Square 54 percent to $850 million. Losses increased to $154 million though. Most surprising of all, their deal to process Starbucks has actually caused them to lose $28 million.</p><p>But at the end of the day, I'll get back to your question. Here we see razor-thin margins and a very competitive field --</p><p>QUEST: Right, but -</p><p>BURKE: -- the same thing that has hurt the other IPOs.</p><p>QUEST: The difference though with something like Square and it's always a risk of newer technology or a better mousetrap, but at least they're making a product which is clearly in demand. They've got competitors unlike some companies which are just mist on the waters.</p><p>BURKE: That's right, and that's part of the reason that they want to do their IPO. And they know they've got the revenue coming in, they need the money to continue to attract new clients.</p><p>But another reason that they want to do it - because they just want to stay ahead of the competition. A lot of people recognize that if Square doesn't act now, those competitors are going to get the best of them.</p><p>And yes, there's a lull but a lot of people are expecting big numbers for those other companies and it shows.</p><p>QUEST: So, I know Square obviously warned about Dorsey spending time between Square and Twitter. How much of that is a real concern? Because new companies - I mean, most companies - shouldn't just be completely dependent on the chief executive.</p><p>But new companies tend to be more reliant on the ability of the CEO.</p><p>BURKE: And this is uncharted territory. It's very rare to see the CEO of two companies of this size in charge - Jack Dorsey in charge of Twitter, Jack Dorsey in charge of Square.</p><p>Take a look at this little nugget that I found in there prospectus, and it took some people by surprise because Jack Dorsey has been so confident. He said -- or rather in the prospectus for Square - they say quote, \"This may at times adversely affect his ability {Jack Dorsey's ability}to devote time, attention and effort to Square.</p><p>Now, when I talked to Jack Dorsey about his last year, he said, listen, they're right next door to each other, I can easily cross the street and go from one to another.</p><p>He makes it sound almost as easy as you, Richard, going from one show to another - \"Business Traveler\" to \"Quest Means Business,\" but it might be a little bit tougher than that. At least that's what some of the investors are thinking.</p><p>QUEST: Yes, I mean, many CEOs run much bigger companies than those two and manage to do so successfully. Dorsey can do it. (RINGS BELL). Thank you, Samuel Burke in London.</p><p>Coming soon to a stock exchange near you, an IMAX IPO in Hong Kong that's been a blockbuster success. Chief exec of IMAX joins me next. \"Quest Means Business.\"</p><p>[16:42:35] QUEST: Can't beat a good movie and a good evening at the C-Ma (ph) -- going to the pictures as we used to say. Well, IMAX has continued its winning streak in Hong Kong, defying the recent volatility from the region.</p><p>The shares in the movie company's Chinese offshoot debuted in Hong Kong a week ago and today they're at more than 20 percent since then.</p><p>Richard Gelfond is the IMAX chief executive and appropriately for chief, he's with me in the C Suite.</p><p>Now 20 percent?</p><p>RICHARD GELFOND, CEO, IMAX: It's really 35 percent, Richard, but I hate to correct you.</p><p>QUEST: When you're talking about that sort of level, you can correct as much as you like, sir.</p><p>GELFOND: OK, sorry.</p><p>QUEST: Were you seriously worried about this going ahead when you'd seen what was happening?</p><p>GELFOND: The answer would be yes. We filed in around April or May. I was there in June for kind of pre-IPO meetings and I felt like the hottest commodity in town. I had 61 meetings and people were like how much can I buy, how fast?</p><p>And then we had planned on going right around Labor Day, and the markets had been really volatile and as you know they devalued the ranum be (ph) and the market hit its lowest point in two years.</p><p>And sure I was worried. I mean, you know, you could not be worried.</p><p>QUEST: So why didn't you pull it? Because we've seen cases - I remember WizzAir in London literally pulled their IPO within days of when it was supposed to happen. Why did you decide not do that?</p><p>GELFOND: Because we were going to own 70 percent of it after the IPO happened and we were only selling 7 percent in the IPO.</p><p>So I wasn't so concerned about what the price was in the IPO as I was about where it traded in the aftermarket so we could create long-term value which is why we did it.</p><p>So I view windows as either opened or closed and, you know, I didn't need the last nickel and it made sense for me to wait a while to see if we could sneak through.</p><p>And the Fed didn't raise interest rates as you know at the end of September and we found a window.</p><p>QUEST: This is fascinating because I'm getting real insight into the sort of decisions you have to make and we often don't hear about in terms of an IPO.</p><p>In the days after and the week after, we've seen this 35 percent rise in the level. What's driving that? Is it speculation or is it fundamental?</p><p>GELFOND: I think it's more fundamental. I think one reason that it was priced lower than it could have been is where investors were just skittish about IPOs in general.</p><p>[16:45:04] QUEST: But that really - but that meant leaving some money on the table.</p><p>GELFOND: That meant leaving money on the table, but our book was very strong. We were more than five times oversubscribed and remember this is discretionary consumer in China.</p><p>This isn't export, this isn't manufacturing, and that segment has done extremely well, Richard. So I felt good about it.</p><p>There's a lot of demand, the road shows were full, and I think the bankers who did a good job priced it deliberately a little lower so it would trade well.</p><p>QUEST: And what did you do with the money?</p><p>GELFOND: Some of the money is going to be reinvested in China and we're going to build a post-production facility, a screening room, invest in more theater deals in China, more joint ventures.</p><p>And then the amount we sell - the amount we sold - we're going to keep on our balance sheet to do better things.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you, sir, I appreciate it.</p><p>GELFOND: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed. Now from the small screen - from the big screen and the small screen - to the very small screen.</p><p>GoPro is used for all sorts of extreme sports and GoPro shares have been on an extreme downhill slide. GoPro's fallen more than 50 percent this year.</p><p>The company does have ambitions to get some uplift - it's taking on the drone market. And its chief exec Nick Woodman told Maggie Lake that the company plans to roll out its own version of (GESTURES) next year.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>NICK WOODMAN, CEO, GOPRO: We definitely are on track to introduce our drone for the first half of 2016, and we're really excited about it.</p><p>And it's going to be a differentiated experience that I think is going to be extremely well received by GoPro existing and new customers.</p><p>Even though we don't yet have a drone product in the market, I think GoPro has been such a big part of why consumers are so interested in drones and in other flying camera solutions -- because the drone market really took off when people started mounting GoPros specifically on drones.</p><p>A lot of the drones that are flying, they already are GoPros in a sense, and so I think that that gives us a distinct advantage against say another company that was entering the market that had no history in that space whatsoever.</p><p>(END VIDEOCLIP)</p><p>QUEST: GoPro in the market and Rich Gelfond pulling us right in terms of the price at which his IPO. It was fascinating actually to hear an IPO - to hear a CEO - talk about an IPO, something they're often frequently reluctant to do so.</p><p>Here in the United States you are expected to tip on just about everything. Now a campaign has begun to curb the tipping activity. There's a major boost to the anti-tipping movement. @RichardQuest on your thoughts of what you think about tipping.</p><p>We're going to talk about it after you've watched a highlight from \"Make, Create, Innovate.\" (RINGS BELL).</p><p>[16:50:43] QUEST: Welcome to the restaurant. You are most welcome. And now one of New York's top restauranteurs has joined the no-tipping movement.</p><p>Danny Meyer's banning the practice at his full-service restaurants starting late next month. It's a major change for New Yorkers. Indeed, tipping is pretty much engrained in this society.</p><p>For instance, look at what TripAdvisor says, \"Tipping is a part of our service economy and our taxation system, and all visitors should understand that it is part of our local culture.\"</p><p>Is it really? Joining me now to talk about this is Drew Neiporent, the owner of Myriad Restaurant Group. Good to see you, sir.</p><p>DREW NIEPORENT, OWNER, MYRIAD RESTAURANT GROUP: Likewise. Did you leave a tip the last time you were at Nobu?</p><p>QUEST: The bill -</p><p>NIEPORENT: Maybe not because in London it's value added, right? And it's 12 points price (ph) -</p><p>QUEST: No, no - you still -- there's still a tip -- a line for the tip you can always add in. But here's the point, here's the point - are you going to follow Meyer and other's lead in this regard or are you just thinking about whether you should?</p><p>NIEPORENT: No, we've though this - you know - Danny and I actually came up together in 1985 at a restaurant called Mon Triche (ph). They still have Trifecta Grill and Nobu for over 25 years. No, but whatever.</p><p>Danny's a terrific person and perhaps this works for his group. Economics of the restaurant business are miserable, Richard. They just don't work.</p><p>And the tipping equation is part of American culture, and it might work for Danny Meyer, but it doesn't work for the vast majority of restaurants in this country.</p><p>QUEST: But the problem is not tipping per se because, you know, wherever you travel in the world you leave a tip on the restaurant.</p><p>It's got out of control in the United States some people would say. This idea of a 20 percent tip - on a meal that was probably quite expensive to start with.</p><p>NIEPORENT: But, Richard, let me tell you. These are hardworking people and, you know, this is a complicated issue. I would acknowledge that.</p><p>QUEST: Yes.</p><p>NIEPORENT: But to just go to the extreme. You're not a stupid person - if you're leaving 20 percent on $100, that's $20. Danny Meyer's going to charge you 30 percent more on the prices.</p><p>So he's looking at you and he's saying, you know what, you don't have to leave a tip. But he's banging you for another 30 percent, not 20 percent. And that is where the problem lies.</p><p>He's not doing you any favors.</p><p>QUEST: I wonder though when you talk about this, I've always had the feeling that you're transferring your wage bill to me.</p><p>NIEPORENT: OK that's - but everything is transferred to you. You're the customer. Everything that we charge based - is based on - us being able to meet our expenses to be able to stay in business.</p><p>And you're looking at somebody who's opened over 40 restaurants in the last 30 years, all around the world including in the communist country known as California -</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NIEPORENT: And where I did pay wages of $10 per hour, and guess what? Everyone got paid except for us, the investors.</p><p>QUEST: So would you be in favor or do you believe that tipping should be withheld in the case of bad service? Unlike as it (AUDIO GAP) somebody run down the street after me saying you didn't leave me a big enough tip.</p><p>We've all heard those stories. But -</p><p>NIEPORENT: As long as they didn't do anything to your food while you were still there. But the answer is -</p><p>QUEST: (LAUGHTER).</p><p>NIEPORENT: -- of course, Richard, you're allowed - you're the guest.</p><p>QUEST: Right.</p><p>NIEPORENT: And if you don't receive commensurate service, you're entitled to leave whatever you desire which includes zero.</p><p>But the truth is, is that we're in a service business and these people work hard and they deserve that 15 or 20 percent that you've been leaving - that millions of people tonight will leave in restaurants in New York City.</p><p>QUEST: Do you think the law should be changed in the United States so that tips can be shared? Tips coming through to the front -</p><p>NIEPORENT: Absolutely.</p><p>QUEST: -- because many people don't realize that tips given to waiters or the waiting staff cannot be shared by federal law with those back of house.</p><p>NIEPORENT: Absolutely, because the generation that you're looking at in Danny Meyer, what we did want to try to do when we first came up was make the system equitable.</p><p>And that would have been to take gratuities and share them equitably with our entire staff. And then we got kicked in the teeth because there were lawsuit after lawsuit - basically ambulance-chasing attorneys. None of these things got adjudicated in law, we all have to settle because you know how lawyers can be.</p><p>And anyway, the bottom line is, yes, without a question the law should be changed about the distribution of gratuities.</p><p>[16:55:05] QUEST: I wish I had a glass to say cheers.</p><p>NIEPORENT: I was about to say, this is the only time I had never been offered a glass of wine (LAUGHTER). Thank you, Richard, you're tremendous at what you do.</p><p>QUEST: Next time in your restaurant.</p><p>NIEPORENT: I hope so. Thank you very much.</p><p>QUEST: Thank you very much indeed.</p><p>NIEPORENT: Thank you.</p><p>QUEST: We will have a \"Profitable Moment\" after the break.</p><p>QUEST: Tonight's \"Profitable Moment.\" Claire Sebastian brought us a report this evening that showed how the hospitality industry is dealing with the very serious question of child sex trafficking.</p><p>It's gratifying to see that an industry which so often wants to look in the opposite direction is finally admitting that there is a problem and they're going to do something about it.</p><p>The World Tourism Organization has for a long time made it clear that things have to change. And if you ever try and get a tourist company to talk about something as serious as this, well they just push it to one side.</p><p>It's the nasty side of tourism that nobody ever wants to face up to.</p><p>Thankfully people like Hilton, Marriott, the big airlines are now saying that they will not shove this aside. They will acknowledge there's a problem and they will do something about it.</p><p>There's absolutely no room in any form of an industry for the sort of industry - child sex tourism - that has been taking place. And the gratification that now those companies are doing something about it must be celebrated.</p><p>And that is \"Quest Means Business\" for tonight. I'm Richard Quest back in New York. Whatever you're up to in the hours ahead, (RINGS BELL) I hope it's profitable. We'll do it again tomorrow.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2015101501cbk27</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5H58-PPB1-JB20-G54D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7040\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>October 15, 2015 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC00062F9</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN FINANCIAL SERVICES AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001RKX</classCode><className>GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0002OOA</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN GROUP OF AMERICA INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>FEDERATION INTERNATIONALE DE FOOTBALL ASSOCIATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNION OF EUROPEAN FOOTBALL ASSOCIATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>EUROPEAN POLICE OFFICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL POLICE ORGANIZATION (INTERPOL)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522220 SALES FINANCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>SIC6331 FIRE, MARINE, &amp;

What a great movie. And every time we see it, we just feel so proud of being part of this fantastic industry, of these fantastic times. We are lucky to be present just here and now given the great transformation that will take place in the coming years that is already taking place. And we will have plenty of time this afternoon to talk about that, what will happen here and now, what is happening here and now but also what will happen in the future.</p><p>I'm Martin Lundstedt, the President and CEO of the Volvo Group, and I would like to wish all of you most welcome to Gothenburg. We are happy this time to have the opportunity to host you at Volvo Trucks Experience Center or Volvo Group Experience Center to test and feel our different products but also to have good conversations with the different teams working at Volvo.</p><p>Our program and agenda of the day will be a little bit mixed actually. We will start with a short introduction by me about where we stand from a value and culture and strategy point of view. Jan Ytterberg will go through the financial performance and also the business cycle management. We will have Lars Stenqvist talking about technology but, more importantly, what that would bring when it comes to new business models and reshaping the future of transportation and infrastructure. After the break, we will have also an opportunity to meet a number of our customers that we are doing the partnership together with. And then we will have an exciting Tech Expo, where our expo teams also will go through a number of the innovations that we are working on as we speak. Melker Jernberg will then continue with the Volvo Construction Equipment story. And finally, it's time for plenty of questions in whatever area you would like to ask.</p><p>I should say also the good news about that is that we have a very strong lineup from our Executive Board and management team here today. Actually, where should I start? Maybe I should start with you, if we have -- if you can stand up, Bruno Blin, who is our President for Renault Trucks; we have Roger Alm, who is the President of Volvo Trucks; we have H\u00c3\u00a5kan Agnevall, President of Volvo Buses; and we have Diana Niu, our HR, global HR leader. We have Scott Rafkin, who is the President of Volvo Financial Services; Bj\u00c3\u00b6rn Ingemanson, President of Volvo Penta, and that's the high season now, so I can understand if it will be a long line up with Bj\u00c3\u00b6rn now; and we have Sofia Fr\u00c3\u00a4ndberg, who is our Legal and Compliance Officer, also sitting in the Executive Board; Kina Wileke, Head of Communications for the group; Jan Ohlsson, Global Head of Operations. We have Jan Gurander, sorry, Deputy CEO of the group; Andrea Fuder, who is our Chief Procurement Officer, Head of Purchasing; Melker, you will meet later, the President of VCE; Lars Stenqvist, our CTO, Chief Technology Officer; and Jan Ytterberg, our CFO. Anyone who feels that they have been forgotten? It feels good, it feels good. Very good.</p><p>So I'll take the opportunity now to utilize the fact that we have a strong lineup discuss different topics in detail with the different expert areas obviously. So we are here for you and obviously to have a good conversation during the day.</p><p>Before I'm coming into my presentation, also this morning, we had another very important milestone for the Volvo Group when it comes to taking transportation logistics to the next level, and that was with the announcement of a very, very important partnership for the most advanced part of autonomous driving. So if you can please welcome me to give a hand to Jensen Huang, the Founder and CEO of NVIDIA. Great to see you, Jensen, and thank you for coming, especially for us, both for the partnership and also for attending this Capital Markets Day.</p><p>JEN-HSUN HUANG, CO-FOUNDER, CEO, PRESIDENT &amp; DIRECTOR, NVIDIA CORPORATION: Yes, this is a very special day for me, too. I wouldn't have missed it for the world.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you very much for that. And as you know, most of you know, you are well into our business. NVIDIA is a very, very strong company working in different -- variety of fields but has been investing heavily into the mobility sector now for a couple of years. I will let you comment on that.</p><p>But before letting Jensen comment on that, some small comments from myself, why this is so important to the Volvo Group. And that is from the fact that we have been working together already for a number of years now, NVIDIA and Volvo, obviously. As you have seen, we have done gradual announcements of our autonomous journey, of our connectivity journey, our electromobility journey.</p><p>We are rolling out a number of both pilots, but more importantly, commercial solutions as we speak. But now we are taking this partnership to the next level, and we are taking that partnership into the next level when it comes to the fully autonomous solutions for level 4, level 5 for on-road applications going into the future. And as you know, that is by far the most complex environment. Even if we will see a number of applications already coming into place now, that is the next step.</p><p>And then we said, I mean, partnership is the new leadership, if you allow me to say that, Gustav. And if we are to succeed in the future, having the speed, quality, but more importantly, the safety of these solutions and to gain the benefits of autonomous driving when it comes to the environmental impact and, eventually, as a consequence, productivity, you need to partner up with the best guys and not doing only as a partnership of a normal level. But because in this world, the unknown is the new normal, and that partnership must be built on trust. And that's the reason why it was so important for us to have the opportunity today to actually sign this next level of long-term partnership with NVIDIA.</p><p>So Jensen, for us, a great day, how do you feel about it then?</p><p>JEN-HSUN HUANG: Thank you. Well, this is a huge day. You know very well that our 2 industries are separate industries. And since its founding, the 2 industries have remained separate for -- until now. And today, we announced the partnership of leaders from 2 different industries combining into 1 partnership to develop the future. And so the first thing I want to say is that I'm so pleased that we're part of Martin and his management team's transformation and reinvention of this industry into a technology industry.</p><p>This is the beginning of something very, very large. Now we stand at a time when the discovery of some of the most important technology of the future has been found. As you know very well, artificial intelligence is the most powerful technology force the industry has ever known. And for the very first time, we can imagine applying this technology to solve some great challenges that no one has ever known a solution for, and that is the autonomy and the automation of transportation.</p><p>This -- the challenges that we need to overcome together as a team is really quite extraordinary. This is the first and the largest endeavor that has been announced of our industry, the world leader of commercial vehicles and our company working on high-performance computing and artificial intelligence over a decade now coming together to solve this problem.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: And what I think is important, as Jensen said also, I mean this is a very extensive partnership, both when it comes to the simulation because this requires a lot of -- obviously a lot of data, enormous amount of data, a lot of type of simulation, integration into the stack when it comes to the decision-making brain, you can say, of the vehicle, but also everything that comes around. It's not only a classical, so to speak, hardware and then a layer of software but an integrated system for taking us to the next step.</p><p>JEN-HSUN HUANG: Everything that we're going to do has never been done before. The way the software is developed, the algorithms of this new approach, the type of computers that we will use to run the software is all completely revolutionary. And when we combine all of that, we're going to transform the automotive industry, the transportation industry into a software-defined industry, and we'll be one of the most advanced technology industries in the world.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: I thank you, Jensen, for that. And then I can say also that what is interesting for us is that we are sitting on a number of capabilities obviously in the Volvo Group both when it comes to self-driving capabilities in confined areas, also in even bigger complex areas and the [whole were done down] to base technology that is completely new to what you see on the road today, the Volvo dynamic steering systems that makes, so to speak, the full control. But to take this to the new level of full autonomous on-road applications, you need really to partner with the best. And it was really great to have you here today. And...</p><p>JEN-HSUN HUANG: It's such a great honor.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: So let's work together and take it to the next level.</p><p>JEN-HSUN HUANG: Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you very much.</p><p>JEN-HSUN HUANG: We're going to invent the future together. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you. And we will continue to talk about that during the afternoon, but again, we have to say that it's so important for us to show that winning the territories in the future will be a lot about continuing this type of cooperations. That has been true in a lot of different spaces for Volvo Group. But now when we are entering into electromobility, automation and obviously connectivity, such an important step.</p><p>Having said that, yes, there we see the line, and sorry for that. We should have had that, Jensen. I mean, we have a number of lines there. And the good news about this is also that this is a rendering done also by the world-famous also rendering team of NVIDIA. So you can see it looks like -- it looks as good as it does in reality. So what can be better?</p><p>Good. Then coming into the theme of today. We will talk about here and now, as I said, but also to the future. And just as a very quick backdrop, I've been 30 years myself in this industry, and it has never been more interesting and encouraging to be working here. First and foremost, because you can make a long list of different figures, I'll just pick the number here that will show that it will be continuous growth in our industry, in logistics and in infrastructure and development. And the reasons are obvious, obviously.</p><p>Already by 2030, we will be 8 billion people in the world global. Most of that growth will come in areas that have still immature logistics. We know that it will not only be 8 billion people, but it will be in a completely different world when it comes to digitalization and opportunities that will bring with it, so to speak.</p><p>But we also see both already announced because many of those are very long-term plans, infrastructural investments coming into play. Here, we have a number of figures up to 2040, but more will eventually come. And a big part of that will come into roads that directly will affect, of course, our way of providing solutions for our customers but also how we actually can participate in building that infrastructure.</p><p>E-commerce has just started. Depending on where you see it now in different parts of the world, we see a big impact on how transportation, logistics are organized and how our type of more advanced solutions can play an even bigger role. But obviously, this can only be done if we are also taking the responsibility that we need for the world. The winners tomorrow will not only be the guys that are counting the money. The winners tomorrow, and I think all of us in this room should reflect on that, will be the guys that can count the money but doing so by knowing that we have provided that within the boundaries that this planet can actually take.</p><p>And I'm actually encouraged to see that this type of conversation is coming more and more to the table of decision-makers all around the globe. How will we be able to hand over this planet and, equally so, our company to the next generations in good hands knowing that we have provided good solutions that have been driving prosperity on society for -- prosperity for society but also prosperity for the stakeholders of Volvo Group. And I think the good news is that this channel will be combined if we do it in a smart way utilizing, so to speak, the drive in society through transport solutions by also taking care of the future when it comes to safety, environmental care, social benefits, et cetera.</p><p>If you look at the world, you have seen this slide before, but for me it's important to take this thought. Still the world is highly diversified when it comes to logistical efficiency. The most advanced countries in the world today, logistics represent approximately 7%, 8% of GDP. But in the less advanced economies, still logistics count for a very big proportion, and the efficiency gains and opportunities are enormous, obviously.</p><p>If you take China, that's the reason why this is one of the top priorities both when it comes to infrastructure development but also when -- how it comes to transportation development. And gradually, we will see this curve bending down. India, for example, that will continue to go up until it will bend down again. And the reason is simple. When value chains are developing, actually the factories and the manufacturing centers are developing first, logistics second. And therefore, when efficiency is coming into manufacturing, by nature, since it must add up to 100%, right, logistics would take a bigger place. And then eventually, the curve will bend down again.</p><p>And why is it so? Every industry that you are meeting will say the following. This is very unique and complex and special. And I will not say super special with logistics but what is special is that the value chain as such is not that visible. There are many actors, it's rather fragmented, there are a lot of room for suboptimization and a lot transactional parts in the flow. And by new technologies, we can address that part.</p><p>And already here, you see that there are enormous potential continue to drive efficiency and, thereby, also environmental development for the emerging parts of the world where our type of solution will play an increasingly important role obviously. And we see that also with the growth in those areas.</p><p>The good news, though, is even if you have 7%, like Scandinavia or whatever, in those 70%, the waste is enormous. I mean if you think about the asset utilization of a truck, of a construction equipment unit, it is probably somewhere between 25% and 35%. If I should ask one of my production managers if you have the 25% to 35% utilization rate of our transfer lines in our powertrain production, I think we should have a rather long conversation. And this is production equipment, right? The load utilization factor is still also very low, 60%, 70%. And then you can see also how much amount if you really calculated the full transport work, et cetera. You have a number of factors, and then you have the safety piece obviously. Still one of the most dangerous part of working environment, the traffic situations where a lot needs to be done and which also have big societal losses obviously. So also in this way of looking into the mature markets, potential is enormous.</p><p>So for us, and that is the main theme today. We will talk about perform because in order to be the transformation leader on logistics and our industry, we need to perform constantly, long term [consist] to manage short term. We need to know where we are going, but we need also to be sure that we can go there because we have a strong company and a strong balance sheet and a strong innovation platform to build on.</p><p>We are in the Volvo Group well invested. And often when we think about well invested, we think about products, we are thinking about factories, we are thinking about networks. And that is true. We are well invested in products, in innovation and in [EMCs], et cetera. But in this transformation that is coming up now, maybe the most important is we are well invested in the customer base. We have close relations with our customers. They are operating in all parts of the world, and they are operating in a number of industrial verticals that will actually drive this transformation like ports, quarries, terminals, what have you. And therefore, that is also starting points that people tend to forget, that when you have built that trust over time, when it comes to doing business together, you can also continue to build this journey when it comes to innovation.</p><p>When you do a snapshot about where we are operating and the majority of our business are located today when it comes to the industrial verticals and segments, you see, for example, building and construction, very big, both VCE, Volvo Construction Equipment, but also Trucks, the different divisions. And we see that for Volvo Penta obviously in the industrial segments where we are supplying solutions to many of the equipment builders and also genset manufacturers, to mention a few. You have, for example, mining and quarry. And the reason why I'm mentioning those as 2 examples and highlighting them, they are opted obviously for disruption when it comes to autonomous, electrified and connected. And what we feel more and more now when we see those type of industrial verticals and when we talk to the customer base that we have, our customers, the bigger actors, they say, \"guys, we want you to come as a global team, a key account who work together in the full scope of it because this is not a unit game anymore. This is a solution game where you need really to define the flows and when it comes to safety and when it comes to environmental outcomes and when it comes to different parts, so very important. And here, we will continue now after the brand decentralization also to continue to drive decentralization and clarity around this when it also comes to key account and industrial verticals.</p><p>And the key enabler that we have here is our Volvo Financial Services organization, global, well presented and also needs to know by detail also the different industrial verticals' logic from a financial point of view as well.</p><p>Other strong assets to build on. We have clarified, on the left side, what you see is the example on the Trucks side. We have now clarified our brand positioning and how do we utilize the strength of the different brands in a good and clear way. We have one global brand on -- in all different product lines and that is Volvo operating all parts of the world. And then we are complementing that with strong local or regional brands that actually can take their fair share of the market -- when it comes to Renault, for example, Europe, Northern Africa, Middle East and some other selected markets; we have Mack in North America and Australia; and we have UD now continuously expanding in the Asian footprint but also in other selected markets. And then complementing that proudly also with our joint ventures of Dongfeng in China and with Eicher of India. That is not -- as you know, not only a cooperation when it comes to market presence but also when it comes to production capabilities, sourcing cooperations and carryback when it comes to certain technologies that will feed certain markets where they are not operating but the group is operating.</p><p>The application excellence is, of course, key here. Not only that we have a strong customer base and that we're operating geographically and in different industry but how does their balance sheet look like, how does their income statement look like, how does their cost situation look like and where can we actually help and support them to improve that? The interesting part of the application excellence journey we see is that, traditionally, we have been focusing a lot and we continue to do so on the cost piece for our customers, fuel economy, repair and maintenance cost, wear and tear, et cetera. But more importantly now we see how connectivity and other solutions are driving us up through their P&amp;L up to the top line piece of it, revenue streams, environmental performance, more and more important, uptime obviously, et cetera, et cetera, so application excellence. And there is no one size fits all. I can tell you, ladies and gentlemen, we are by far now moving beyond the world of average. Average is the mother of nothing. And if you want to win here, you need to have the application excellence and really make sure where is your depth of engagement for the different applications.</p><p>Synergies, as you know, one of the most overrated words in the world because the problem with synergies is that what we learn in school is this, you will get it for free. This is the y-axis, and this is the x-axis. And on the y-axis, you have dollar per unit, right? And on the y-axis -- and on the x axis, you have volume. And then you know what, the line looks like this. Fantastic. The problem is that if you are not careful, you have another small curve coming up, creeping up, and that is called bureaucracy and bul(expletive) and steering committees and [others' everythings.] And if you are not really clear about what is what here and in what verticals you can work with the synergies, you can be in a really, really, really bad situation.</p><p>But on the other hand, if you are really thinking through where does synergies matters and why, you can be in a good situation. And I'm proud to say that I feel that we have been working through that. We have had -- in Sweden, we always say wrongly \"high up to the roof\" but it's \"high up to the ceiling\" and discuss that a lot, what synergies really matter for us and what does not. And that has been also the play about decentralized and power organization when it comes to a lot of decision-making to get speed and agility and, on the other hand, then get the synergies where it matters. Powertrain is a very famous one both when it comes to technology and volumes and scale but also now moving into parts of the powertrain arena where we have not done so with VCE, with Penta, with Buses and also with the medium duty offering for the whole group as one example. We see that in distribution, financial services again, and we see that in some of the common services where we see that is serving us well, technology areas, model platform and not at least now in electromobility, automation and connectivity. And Lars will come back to that in more detail later on here.</p><p>The journey continues. Strong growth and expansion for 10, 15 years, a consolidation after the great recession, obviously, a lot of focus of internally to get back together all the platforms and the economy and product renewals mainly in Europe, et cetera; and from '15, '16, a new focus of this decentralized organization with a strong customer focus, continuous improvement and build on the assets that we have built up over many years to come here and work on it. We're happy. We feel that is working. It's serving us well.</p><p>If I may say anything of the words that we put up there, '16, I'm very happy with the customer focus in the organization. The beauty with a decentralized organization is that more people have the fantastic opportunity to meet customers. Money is not falling down from heaven. They are coming from customers that want to work with the Volvo Group. And the more people that can be engaged in those interfaces, feel the heat and win together, the more we will win as a team.</p><p>Very happy with the continuous improvement journey and how we are driving that culture, organic growth. I will never be happy, by the way, with the speed and agility and the simplicity because the day you say now we are simple enough, where we have speed enough, then I should move to Portugal or wherever. That is feasible. And -- but having said that, so for us, we are very happy with what we see, what we have constructed, and that is based on common values. The values of building, so to speak, a future, short term -- a long term consist to manage short term.</p><p>And we are obsessed in this group. We know that prosperity is built by, among other things, logistics and transport solutions. We see that clear link. We see that short term, and we see that long term. And we are obsessed about being part of that transformation, the big societal challenges but, at the same time, have a good and strong and solid and sustainable performance for all our stakeholders within the group. And that is possible to combine, and that is so fantastic.</p><p>We're happy to see that this pyramid is representing what we are. We have a strong base of code of conduct. We want to win because we are the best. We want all our 105-plus thousand colleagues to feel the strength of, that we have strong values and way of operating, so we can win because we are the best and that was the right choice for our customers. And also, we see that we are moving in our different aspirations for the key stakeholders, working fine, continue to drive it in the best possible way.</p><p>We also launched 2016 for the next step, the 7 strategic priorities for us. We have said consistency is the key now. We can incorporate the main activities both when it comes to the long and short term into this. In number 3, for example, we are hosting the next level of service and product portfolio platforms, the solutions that Lars will talk about given the opportunities with the new technologies.</p><p>And we see clearly that we are leveraging from both sides, the group assets that we have for all business areas and the rationale for us of still being one group. We are operating in a way where we are saying this, together with this, that our 10 business areas around are run on 2 principles. Principle number one, everyone is responsible for their customer satisfaction, growth and profitability; and principle number two, utilize whatever you like in the Volvo Group to improve number one, pull instead of push.</p><p>The good news about this is, is that we see now that we are on a good trajectory, we will continue to drive that. And that is -- of course, still a lot of good opportunities to improve and continue to improve the performance of the Volvo Group. We are not there yet. I've got the other week a question from someone who said, \"Okay, now Martin, in your (inaudible) journey, where are you?\" I think, since I'm an engineer, you know I would try to answer in percentage points. And I saw that the audience were expecting, okay, you are probably 75% down the road, but probably we are 28% to 29% down the road, maybe to 30%.</p><p>And the reason is simple. It takes time. And it takes time to build that and continue to have this owner mentality, the right balance in the group, et cetera. But the energy and the direction is there. And we see and feel so many opportunities.</p><p>And the good news for us is obviously that we feel that by continuing to improve this, we can both fund the transformation that is needed to be the driver, to invest the right amount of money into innovation, research, to be attractive to the best partners like NVIDIA, for example, while also giving the right shareholder return, to be an attractive player also when it comes to shareholders, stakeholders and, of course, our employees and colleagues.</p><p>Perform is therefore one of the keywords that we are working with. We don't want to be seen as, I mean, working with ongoing concern of the business daily to take care of the customers, to cherish and to get from time to time these feedbacks where they say, guys, you need to improve here and there. It should not be seen as this is something that some people are doing but the rest is working with transformation, to be part of here and now and why the business is fantastic. And there is so many great opportunities. That is the block we called Perform.</p><p>And when we look at excelling on the basics in the group, there is -- there are still plenty of opportunities. We base that on the Volvo Production System. It started actually in the production sphere. When it comes to teamwork, a continuous improvement, visualization, flow thinking, keep it simple, use the right technology when it's needed, take out the wrong technology when it's not needed, et cetera. But the good news is that we are expanding this constantly. We are expanding that upstreams to our supplier partners, supporting each other to have that visibility, and we have a lot of work ongoing there. We are expanding these downstreams to our dealerships, to our customers. And maybe we will hear a little bit about that later on here when we are defining the new structures with autonomous and electromobility. A lot of that is based on the Volvo production thinking when it comes to value stream optimization.</p><p>But the best news of that is that the #1 parameter that is coming out on top when you're working on this is safety, that we can actually stand in front of our colleagues and say that we have one obligation, and that is bringing our colleagues home and ourselves home safely to families and friends.</p><p>Then quality is coming. And when quality is coming, productivity and efficiency is coming, so really work with the means to get the right outcome.</p><p>On the right side, you see a number of the key areas that we are addressing through this way of working. Agility and flexibility, adaptation in volumes obviously is a key area that we are always into and continuously improving, so we have the right speed and the means to actually -- we are after all in a cyclical business. We have to live with it. And we have to make sure that we can do that.</p><p>The common architecture and shared technology, the cost system is the key enabler for hovering between the global and the local, between the right type of scale and, so to speak, the local agility and owner's mentality. To really find this modular platform, we have come a long way, very small things to do and not at least in the new technology areas.</p><p>Continuous instead of concentrated introductions when it comes to products. Customers couldn't care less about balloons and things like that. They want to move the world and to actually achieve their targets, introduce the new solutions in iteration with the customers constantly, take down risks. Quality is always a concern for us. And we have made fantastic progress. I've told you a number of years ago that we are protecting our customers, but the ticket is too high, and we are addressing that in a very, very positive way and a lot of energy in the whole value chain. This is not an engineering task only. And then obviously, the whole issue of brand and regionalized value chains, decentralized organization, fully accountable P&amp;L organization that can take actions and responsibility and, thereby, adjusting much more quickly.</p><p>We have an installed population of 2.8 million units. And opportunity when it comes to the service business is enormous, obviously. We know everything about the bottom line and what is the percentage points we have in market, et cetera, for the hardware but the further up we go on the road here. And you can just see there, I mean, the untapped potential on the existing fleet, and that is illustrative obviously. We see it for different segments and markets, the different pattern. But I can tell you that this is one of the highest focus that we have in the organization. We follow that value stream by value stream, how does it look for parts, how does it look for workshop hours, insurance, finance packages, coaching, et cetera. And we are also making sure that we're utilizing a number of bundled offering in order to pull this to the right side, service and repair contracts being one of those obviously.</p><p>And just to take the service enablers, some of them that we are actively working on and have good plans. The network obviously, enormous strength of any global player today that we have them in a good reach, and that will continue to be so. We are providing production equipment, right? I mean that will continue to be a big necessity of having strong players out there also serving autonomous electromobility solutions and obviously the normal solutions. The population continue to drive that. Penetration, given for all our services and that is really connected to what I showed here, how do we drive the penetration for the different services? We see, for example, financial services. And when we have the financial package with our customers, it is one-to-one probability that our retention is -- the retention to the Volvo Group is higher, just showing the importance of the business per se but also building a long-lasting relation with our customer base.</p><p>You see a number of that -- more -- other -- very important here, the segment and application thinking beyond average and then, obviously, the contract business.</p><p>On the right side, you see also how it looks like today both when it comes to the most prominent then segments like long haulage, for example, but also where -- and that is what we see, so to speak, for that. But also when we look through the different type of segments, we see different patterns and different penetrations. And that is a high focus area to build the resilience that we would like to have in the group moving forward, the resilience and the customer loyalty. But because the higher the penetration is here, the higher the loyalty is, so it means that we are offering something that they lack.</p><p>A couple of examples and proof points. It's always good to show illustrative examples, but it's good to show some real figures also. Here, you see Europe. Roger, for example, here for Volvo Trucks, the portfolio growth value on service contracts, very, very important driver, as you know, for parts and workshop hours but also other factors. Since 2014, high focus on this, an increase of 72% of the portfolio partly driven by good markets for sure; but also partly driven by FX lately; but to a big extent also driven by real efforts, real penetrations in a number of contracts and also upgrades from service contracts to repair and maintenance contracts.</p><p>Also growing part sales per vehicle in operation is a little bit. We have to take it, I mean, with the real numbers, and we are consolidating and see it's a little bit exaggerated, I have to admit, when it comes to the FX development. But nevertheless, if you take away everything that is excuse management, it is still a good and solid development. And more importantly, we know why it's up and how we can continue to drive that.</p><p>When we look to the North American situation, you have seen this development before, but I think it's more to the right side that is important to look at. We have said that by increasing the proprietary or captive powertrain components, we will continue to drive the parts and the service sales in North America as one key element. And you can see now, I mean, we have been now for a number of years up to rather high levels when it comes to -- or elevated levels when it comes to engines. We have been driving it also strongly now for the transmission offerings both for Mack and Volvo. And you see also, with a little bit of lag, also how service sales are kicking in, in a very positive way. And more importantly, they are also kicking in for our dealers which makes them more resilient, which makes them more willing to invest in the network for the future.</p><p>That outcome ends up being in the service sales development for the group. We had a rather stable situation, partly driven by the part development. Obviously that was negative, after the Great Recession, utilization a little bit. But I have to say that we are not happy but we are at least a little bit happier about seeing this development. And we will continue to drive that. And Jan Ytterberg will also address that a little bit later on, so I will not be so granular. But more importantly for you guys to feel that all the performed part, all the focus areas that we are working, we are working with the methodologies, we are working with the different activities, and we clearly see also the expected outcomes to rise in our figures.</p><p>The famous parking lot, how does it look like? Shouldn't we start to disclose it a little bit more granular? Yes, maybe one day. But let's look at this. What is the development we have seen? If you look at what -- you have here the brand I mentioned on the trucks side. You have the regional dimension on the vertical. And when you look at Volvo, the only change, the positive change is obviously that North America has moved from a yellow position to a green position driven by obviously strong markets but also very, very good reception when it comes to the truck models that we have launched recently. So saw a very good development in Volvo Trucks, obviously.</p><p>Renault is stable, Africa Oceania now with all respect to the rather small piece. And the reason why we have had to draw back that is mainly related to the fact that we have had a very difficult situation in Algeria that is an important market.</p><p>But on this yellow note, I will give you some more flesh on the bone here. I can say that Renault is moving in the right direction in the yellow field, so we have seen an improvement over 2018 and a very good development there.</p><p>Mack, for Australia, moving into green, and given also last year's launch of the new model, it was a tough year for Mack, so it stayed, so to speak, in yellow during that year, but good reception of the model. We are now through the launch, so we are looking forward to interesting development for Mack as well. The biggest improvement in the year in actual figures, in percentage points was made by UD. The problem was that the starting point was rather challenging, but I can tell you just to give you a little bit of flavor on this, they are very close to what we call a yellow. But since we are engineers, we are ruthlessly speaking to the game, and they are all going to (inaudible) but biggest improvement and also close to yellow. And in total and as you can see it that the world actually, for the first time, given those targets, actually ended up in a green position.</p><p>We continue also to work with the portfolio of different types and different angles of the portfolio. Product lines pruning, services, market areas, and what shall we continue, what should we not, what shall we take out, mainly also for the simplicity and the acceleration of that. A number of examples in this is obviously the divestment of WirelessCars that is the PACCAR, and therefore, we're not into PACCARs. It is hosted back to somewhere else, take it out, reduces complexity. We were divesting NHL shares for the hauling equipment in China. It will not add anything to us. It is in better hands with someone else. And we are all rather proud actually that we are starting to see that it's giving good result also when we are comparing with peers in our industry. We are in a good trajectory, we feel it's more to come and we will continue to drive that.</p><p>On the transform part, also very important, to find this balance perform and transform making sure that we are in a competitive position. I'll quickly go back to this. Why transformation? Yes, again, because the world needs that. More environmental performance, we cannot push the boundary -- planetary boundaries that we've done. And also, we see that the opportunities for efficiency and safety gains are enormous. That is the backdrop. So this is the drivers, often we start with this set of drivers, those are the means. Those are the means together with the capability of putting together a business model that will actually work in order to put that to the market. When it comes to electrified and autonomous solutions, we are seeing now that we are moving into a much more a project-based selling organization, and that will, as we go down the road now, also have implications of how we are organizing those verticals in order to drive revenue streams to drive innovation, investments, and also, open up for visibility to the investment community. So there -- more things will come as we go along here. We have, since we met the last time, presented and have launched all product news in all business areas both in electrification, in autonomous, in connectivity solutions, but more importantly, in all geographies in a lot of different industrial segments and verticals and almost all business areas. And the reason is simple. If you're getting these results, and I will not reveal that now because we will hear maybe a little bit more about that later; but if you can take down CO2 with 98% for a world that cannot need it better than ever now, while at the same time taking down energy with 70% and operator cost with 40%, improving safety at the same time. It's not easy, but it's a no-brainer.</p><p>So this is about the continuous work into this solution ladder. We are not na\u00c3\u00afve. Many of our industries and geographies, we'll still be on level 1 and 2, and we are proud about that. We should drive an excellence with them, I mean, the vehicle, the service, the hour, the coffee break, the peace of mind, working on the safety, driver coaching, but gradually if we want to be in this transformation, we need to climb this ladder, we need to drive the capabilities in the business models, the financial models, the setup of how the risk and reward structure should look like, and of course, the technological capabilities to win this in the future.</p><p>So what we are doing now, and we've been doing this for the last couple of years is we are moving from piloting. We need to do pilots, but at the end of the day, start to get tired of pilots and we are moving into commercialization, and that will be greater times ahead actually. So that is a little bit of backdrop where we are standing. And why this is so exciting and why did you -- why you did the right choice of coming here today. And by that it will be more exciting now when I introduce the next speaker and that is Jan Ytterberg, our CFO, for the financial performance update. Please, Jan.</p><p>JAN YTTERBERG, EXECUTIVE VP OF GROUP FINANCE, CFO &amp; MEMBER OF THE GROUP EXECUTIVE BOARD, AB VOLVO (PUBL): Okay. Thank you, NVIDIA, and Jensen and all of you. Looking forward to meet you next time. Okay, it has as Martin was into, it has never been so challenging to be in a business -- this business, as it is right now. I think I have heard from many business leaders many times before standing in front of changes. And this is probably true in each and every specific situation. Perform here and now has always been a way forward to be able to handle this transformation and changes going forward. And of course, this time it's maybe even more important to not lose out on the performance part because we want to play an important role in the transformation and to have and to act from a platform of strength will be key. That will not secure success, but it will sure make it easier. This is still about survival of the fittest, not the biggest. Size will be important because it creates possibility, but it's not an insurance; or as someone said in a core company some years ago, if size was important then dinosaurs would be around.</p><p>Perform is not to continue to do business-as-usual. It's actually about our continuous improvement journey to bring more value to the customers, get our fair share of that and be more efficient by doing that. The journey, we have done as Volvo the last years looking at adjusted operating income has been -- half of that has been related to our own achievements what we can call continuous improvements and the other half has been related to what we can call external market factors such as total market -- we'd maintained market share FX, raw materials, regional mix, et cetera.</p><p>The favorable external market FX will change, and we have to adjust to that. And we also have to continue this own continuous improvement journey to be able to invest for the future and for the transformation and also to bring good returns to shareholders both short term and long term.</p><p>We are still not where we want to be financially. The gradual and consistent earnings improvement must continue and at the same time, we have to ensure reduced volatility in our earnings and cash flow and also in case of decreased amount of transport and delivery of new equipment, be good at it. Volvo learned a hard way what the value of money is after some years of acquisitions and expansions, in combination with lower earnings under a period put pressure on the capital and the funds. The effect of that is, of course, that we cannot lose focus now when we are getting better financials and earnings and the development offerings and inventory the last 1.5 year is something that we must see as a deviation and must handle going forward.</p><p>We are still in a situation where we have depreciation and amortizations being higher than capital expenditures. That will change as we are running the production on high levels, which will trigger replacement needs in our industry -- in our industrial footprint. And also as we are ramping up R&amp;D that will lead to new products, new solution, which in its turn will lead to more investments. And we must be very granular where we are investing and also secure that we have funds for this new business model solution that we have in the transformation part.</p><p>Volvo established financial targets -- 3 financial targets in August of 2017 to focus the organization on organic growth, on improved profitability through the continuous improvement journey and through innovation as well as an industrial balance sheet for the industrial operation to handle, that will be strong debt free to handle cyclicality, and also to provide financial services with good cost position. So the 3 targets are then an operating margin over 10% over business cycle for the group; and industrial operation with no net debt under normal conditions, excluding the pension and leasing liabilities; and also return on equity for financial services that should be 12% to 15% at an equity ratio of 8%. We have reached 2 out of these 3 targets.</p><p>With the favorable cash generation market conditions, we have been able to have an industrial operation that has been debt-free since this target was introduced. In August '17, the resilience towards the cyclicality has, of course, increased at the same time as the net cash has been improved and increased and as you can see, we ended the first quarter at SEK 47.5 billion of net cash. After that just recently -- after that, we had a -- took the decision to dividend out some SEK 20 billion of ordinary and extra dividend.</p><p>The dividend and ordinary dividend and it's gradually increased should be seen also in the light of what we want to continue with that increase, and also that we have seen around -- I'll have some water. The ordinary dividends should be seen in the light of that we've been increasing that and that we have been, over the last years, in dividend out around 40% of our earnings per share in dividend per share. And when we have had the possibility, we have made an extra dividend as we did just recently in April '19.</p><p>Besides the cyclicality aspect of this, we are also committed to the rating, and that's, of course, also committed to the cost for financial services. These are priorities for us as well. And talking about rating, with improved earnings, the cash generation and the balance sheet, we have done -- also got gradually an improved rating. And just recently, we got increased ratings both from Standard &amp; Poor's of getting our long-term rating up to A-, for Moody's up to A3 and R&amp;I up to A+; all of them with stable outlook. And of course, it's always good to be recognized for a job well done, but even though that improvement was already discounted into the credit market, we also saw some lower cost and improved pricing for Volvo Financial Services as a consequence of these rating hikes.</p><p>Talking about financial services. The gradually improved profitability you can see here measured as return on equity. This is, of course, a combination of good transport demand for our customers and also good performance from Volvo Financial Services to handle, mainly in upcoming market but also in some areas, some tougher situations like in Brazil, for instance, some years ago. And as a consequence, the Volvo Financial Services has a good and well-performing portfolio. The market share of captive finance and insurances are important, both for brand loyalty, but also for bringing opportunities of more sales into the group. And presently we are in what we can say the lower level of what we feel as being relevant, but that's, of course, also related to the fact that we have a customer-financed market in general that is extremely competitive.</p><p>The financial target for the group. The operating margin of 10% over the business cycle is a little too early to assess. It's just 2 years down the road, we have not passed the cycle yet, but we can summarize the first 2 years in the words of that the path and improvement is definitely correct one, the level is wrong -- has been wrong. And we should, of course, have been over 10% with those favorable market situations that we have had but we are on a journey and we are on the right path here. And as I said before, the substantial part of the improvement of income is coming from own achievements, it's not related to external market factors.</p><p>So we will reach this target if we can continue with the journey and also if we can show that we are resilient in case of downturn.</p><p>To be able to distance ourselves from our competitors, we need to excel on the basics and what do we mean by -- when we say \"excelling on the basics?\" Well, pretty simply, we shall continuously improve our operations in our day-to-day work and we should be the provider of best life-cycle profitability to our customers.</p><p>And for example, that is everything from the starting point, selling the right product, the right solution to the customer and we also have to think about when we are doing that, that we also go into industrial verticals, where we can get revenue streams going forward as well, such as in mining and construction equipment and vehicles, those are important industrial vehicles -- industrial segments for us.</p><p>It's also about providing the best uptime to our customers, both preventive and, of course, reactive by having competitive contracts and by having best-in-industry service workshops and service mechanics. And as regard to cost per unit into the manufacturing system, we have now asserted stability in our supply chain, which is good because now we can address more of efficiency and productivity, which will be beneficial for our cost positions going forward.</p><p>And the amount of different parts number is a major cost driver in a company. And, of course, if we can leverage further our cost system, we can also improve the cost per unit and also solving the paradox of having more product variants, more performance steps while at the same time, having less of unique parts. Opportunity will also exist in our industrial footprint, including the JVs to get out economies of scale like we are doing with our joint venture in India where we are getting 5- and 8-liter engines from production system that have better cost positions.</p><p>And as regard our product portfolio and our portfolio solution and geographies, we must be sorting out nonperformers. And when we do that, we have to be, without sentimentality, ruthless in doing that.</p><p>Volatility is part of our business, even if we have not noticed that for many years but that should be in our blood. We have during these years handled most increased markets and increased demand, but we have also had some regional downturns, which has tested the organization in Latin America and in North America over the last years.</p><p>As all companies, we have performed a lot of scenario planning. I can see that my fellow team members in export are not looking very happy when I talk about that, but we have done that to be able to see how we can secure our profit and loss and our cash flow and also to already now talk about what priorities are needed, what kind of different decisions do we need to take under different scenarios.</p><p>Transport will always be needed and thereby service of those vehicles. If we go back to 2008, 2009, what Martin called the Great Recession, we can at least call it biggest recession in our industry modern times. We -- the industry lost out some 10% of service volume while at the same time, vehicle deliveries went down with 40%. The last year as we have -- as Martin showed, build vehicle population, younger population, which is good for us because we have the higher market share on the first owner, i.e. the owner that have the vehicle normally between 3 to 5 years. Then we have on the second and third owners something, of course, we are addressing.</p><p>Repair and maintenance contracts are important too for us because they also tie up future revenue stream, which will be important in case of a downturn. And as long as the customers are standing by the orders and they are, we have an order stock to live from and order stock that creates a buffer of time that we can use when we are adjusting our production in to new levels and also adjusting our cost base in general in the company to those new levels.</p><p>The recipe over successful downturn is not so much in the toolbox, you can read that in the university, in the schoolbooks, it's more about the discipline and execution and timing of different activities. And we have done a global S&amp;OP planning that involves the full Executive Board on a monthly basis and we have also what you can call pulse meetings, 1, 1.5 hours where we sit together week -- on a weekly basis, Executive Board, where we can also take adjustments of the supply chain levels if needed.</p><p>After direct material, the biggest cost item is personnel costs and these are, of course, costs that we need decision to change. I mean direct material is -- goes by the volume, so that is 100% volume related. People is cost, people has ambitions, people drives activities, that drives cost. So this is about to be very disciplined in our prioritizations around ambitions to be able to bring down the cost level in the group. And we need to prioritize hard. What to do, what to not do at all or what to not do now is critical for success in the case of a downturn. In the supply chain, we must use the flexibility we already have installed by flexible manning by timelines, et cetera, something we are doing right now when we are taking down production rates in the European production system to reflect the lower demand in Europe and Asia as you saw in the first quarter.</p><p>Our customers are in good financial shape, which is good for financial services. They have a healthy portfolio, but during these years, Volvo Financial Services have also actively worked with the risks in the portfolio both from a geographical perspective, but also from a customer perspective with risk sharing, with syndication and also moving into new geographies and products.</p><p>Martin was into at this slide, actually, the volatility, as you know will occur mainly in the weaker sales, and the weaker gross income. A key ratio to understand how resilient a company like us are for a downturn is to look at what is happening in our service, revenues and service and gross income in relation to our indirect spend, i.e. our selling and admin expenses and R&amp;D. The more the better, of course, and if you have over 100% of gross income from services, you are pretty safe in case of a downturn. And, of course, the indirect cost will decrease in the downturn situation, they are doing that, but not with a same speed and magnitude as you normally lose on the weaker sales and the weaker gross income.</p><p>And as you can see, we have been improving sales and as the gross margin on service is stable over the time. The percentage is stable over the time, also in downturns. We have, of course, also improved our resilience the last 5, 7 years in this area.</p><p>The proof will be in the pudding and we have not had a global downturn that we have tested the company lately, but we have had some regional disruptions or downturns like in Brazil or in this case, the North America, which is in this slide, in slide in 2015 where we actually lost some 39% of truck deliveries. That was the same magnitude as we saw in 29 (sic) [2009] and also with the same speed as we saw in 2009. During this period, we were able to stay on positive numbers in U.S. on the truck operations side. We were also able to show a better margin on group truck segment in total of 1.1% in 2015. These regional settings are, of course, easier to handle in global supply chain in the global production system than when we have a downturn that is more worldwide. That was a good test actually for us of our capabilities in North America, which -- that -- you that have followed us have seen in the past, has been a concern, a problem for us in downturn situation that North America has been a drag for the group. But this is due to a better profit level in general in U.S. and also the things that Martin was into that we have a better service business in general, not at least due to the captive drive lines and also by that more resilient and stronger retail network, which also passed this downturn in a good way.</p><p>We have made an impressive journey as regard to earnings the last years, what we must focus more on is on cash generation and capital efficiency. To visualize that, we actually started to show external loss or return on capital employed for the group to show that balance that needs to have. And as you can see, we have done an impressive journey the last 5, 10 years and we have gone up now in 2.5 years then from 15% to 25%, which is, of course, very impressive; and our aim objective is to follow this path going forward as well.</p><p>We have also, as I was into, delivered a good return to our shareholders by dividend out the last years around 40% of our net income as ordinary dividend and when we have had the possibility and deemed it to be suitable, we've also made an extra dividend.</p><p>Our objective is to continue our path of profitable growth and to be the preferred choice for our customers for our employees and our shareholders. By that, we continue the thrilling journey and Lars Stenqvist into group innovation and our roadmap in that area. Thank you.</p><p>LARS STENQVIST, CTO, EXECUTIVE VP OF GROUP TRUCKS TECHNOLOGY &amp; MEMBER OF THE GROUP EXECUTIVE BOARD, AB VOLVO (PUBL): Thanks, Jan, and good afternoon. I feel like the world is changing faster than ever and our response to that is to increase our speed. Many of us, we met one year ago, in New York at the Capital Market Day, and then I talked to you about our view on new technologies like electromobility, automation and connectivity. And then I thought it was a good idea to bring this slide today to show you what we have showed to the world since last year since we met in New York. And I dare to say that it's rather impressive lineup of proof points in areas like electromobility, automation and connectivity, and it's really truly across the complete Volvo Group. Of course, it makes me extremely proud as the Chief Technology Officer of the group to be able to show something like this. But I always emphasize that technology is never for the sake of technology. And Martin has already been into it. And I never miss an opportunity to include in my presentations that we as the Volvo Group, we believe in more transport demand going forward.</p><p>I know that all the factions in society doesn't agree, but I normally say that I can understand that they have another view. But they're wrong. There will be more transport demand. There are so many indicators pointing in this direction, increased global population, if we're talking about and being serious about economic growth, lifting India, for example, out of poverty, if we're talking about effects of urbanization and not the least, e-commerce, increased transport demand. But at the same time, I am the first one to acknowledge that we cannot just go on with transport as we know it today. The planet cannot just simply cope with something like that, and that means that we need to come up with something else, we need to talk about, we need to develop and deliver the truly sustainable transport system. A lot of those solutions will be based on new technologies. And I normally say that this is the era of engineering in our industry. It has never been so complex, never been so difficult, never been so complicated being an engineer in our industry, but it has never been so far.</p><p>Take electromobility, for example, electric vehicles using green electricity equals 0 greenhouse gas emissions. It's not a small step, it's a giant leap. And during last year, we presented electric solutions in all product areas. Volvo Buses (inaudible) are now taking the step into articulated buses, full-electric, we start with sales later this year. Mack Trucks in U.S., they have showed their first full-electric refuse truck that will be in test operations at a customer in the end of this year. Volvo Trucks North America has announced that their first full-electric vehicle will be a VNR to be operated in California and commercialized next year. Volvo Trucks, I think many of you have seen Vera, full-electric, full-autonomous truck, but in the more traditional offering, we are now starting with Volvo Fl, Volvo FE in customer operations. And Roger and his team, they will open the order book for those vehicles in the end of this year. And the same goes for Renault Trucks when we're talking about Renault D Wide in 0-emission mode.</p><p>Volvo Construction Equipment. We will hear more later today regarding electric side what we can achieve when we're applying electric solutions on a broad scale and also clear announcements on starting to sell full electric compact escalators, full electric compact wheel loaders from next year. And then, Volvo Penta, you see the ferry on the slide. There we are going to utilize the Volvo electric powertrain in order to deliver full-electric ferry on the river in Gothenburg, and you will also see a sailing catamaran using the same powertrain going forward. And yesterday, we announced -- issued a press release on the utilization of the electric train -- electric powertrain into Holborough terminal tractor as well.</p><p>There is definitely a race right now in our industry regarding being quick to market when it comes to full-electric vehicles. Many of the traditional OEMs are spending a lot in this and many startup companies are also spending a lot of money into this.</p><p>In the Volvo Group, we see there's a very clear advantage that we were early out with buses. We have approximately 10 years of experience when it comes to electrified buses both hybrid solutions and full-electric solutions.</p><p>4,500 buses out there with batteries, and we are learning and gaining so much experience on how those batteries are behaving over time, how we can enhance their life, length of a battery, by running it in a more intelligent way and basing it really up on the customer needs.</p><p>Another huge advantage for us in the Volvo Group is really being a big group. Many of our different business areas, they have 2 bonus when we're digging down to it, rather similar needs when it comes to electrification. And if we then apply this in a good way, our modular system that we call CAST, common architecture and shared technology, I dare to say that this is the reason why we have been able during last year to show that impressive lineup of new vehicles across the group.</p><p>Our vehicle concept and electrical concept is very flexible and easy to adapt to the different needs of different business areas. It will lower our development costs and make us quicker. And in the long run, definitely, it will help us to get volumes out in this segment that will help us with the product cost.</p><p>On the truck side, so far, we have limited our offerings to urban applications and partly to construction applications. But it will come into more long-haul operations in line with the development of batteries. We are about to start to commercialize the electric vehicles now, and you can see this in different phases, starting with customers that is demanding this mainly from an image perspective. They are present all across the globe, and they have reasons to show to their customers or to society where they are and that they want to take the lead in this journey, but they are far too few to base this business case upon.</p><p>Next step, and we are already there, is certain segments where it's already today and most certainly tomorrow, possible to calculate a good business case for fully electric vehicles. Incentives in different countries, incentives in different cities will definitely speed up the transition. We hear from many customers that they will be able to charge more for transport if they go CO2-free or sulfur-free.</p><p>And we hear and you hear for safeties that are serious plans in banning diesel vehicles and then, all of the sudden, then the business case is rather simple and straightforward because then it's only zero emission that will be possible. So we see a gradual increase segment-by-segment, country-by-country, also city-by-city, where it will make sense and where fully electric solutions will outcompete more traditional solutions. But it will take time, and it will be a gradual phase-in.</p><p>And the decisive factor for speed is the development of batteries. And it's principally 2 parameters that we are talking about. It's the energy density of the batteries, meaning weight and performance, but also cost of batteries. And the development of cell and density will definitely be decisive when it comes to speed of this transition and as well as the cost of cells, modules and battery packs.</p><p>We have set our battery strategy. We know exactly what we want to do. We knew how we're going to scale this when the market takes off. One of the strategies we have is that we are going to team up with really strong partners in the battery area. Martin was into it, partnerships will be vital in our industry going forward. And earlier, it was not so easy to attract the big battery players. And then we, ourselves, we have spent many meetings together with the big battery producers.</p><p>And 2 years ago -- 2, 2.5, 3 years ago, we were not that attractive. But now when those guys are starting to understand how much energy we need onboard and if they and when they start to understand the annual mileage of our vehicles compared to passenger cars, all of the sudden, we feel that attractiveness of our company and, I dare to say, attractiveness of our industry is increasing for battery suppliers.</p><p>It's extremely important to have cost-efficient solutions for our customers when it comes to batteries. But not only that. We have to work extremely close with our customers to understand how we are going to run those batteries. It will be a big difference if you run a refuse application or if you run a regional distribution application. It will even be so detailed we will go -- we will sit down with each and every customer and decide if it's better to have 4 packs, 5 packs or 6 packs on the vehicle, if it's better to charge over lunch or if it's better to be able to drive the complete day.</p><p>Even we have discussions with those customers if it's good to really maximize the use of the batteries and accept that they need to change batteries in about 3 or 4 years. That might be more beneficial in order to increase the payload of the vehicle over that time. And this means that these vehicles will be more tailor-made, and it will be a much closer relation between the sales crew and the customers, which will increase the loyalty in both directions.</p><p>We don't have any ambition to develop battery cells on our own. We are convinced that there will be a rather few number of players in the world that will be experts on that. But we need to have and we have battery experts already onboard in our company, working extremely close with the big suppliers, specifying our demands and really tailor -- making sure that we can tailor-made the battery packs for the use in our industry.</p><p>But it's not only battery development that will set the pace, also infrastructure, definitely, acceptance from society, investments, public, private investments. This is necessary before we get a deep and broad deployment of electric vehicles into society. We are rather convinced that market forces, together with governmental initiatives, will solve this. But it will be a little bit unbalanced between different markets, different regions in the world, but this will just happen.</p><p>And then when we are into infrastructure, I decided to bring one slide on hydrogen and fuel cells as well. The reason for that is that I often get 3 rather strange questions, of course, not from you but from other guys. I often get the questions, why we believe in electric vehicles and why we don't believe in fuel cell vehicles. And of course, this is clear to most of you or all of you, but I will now take the time to try to sort out some definitions here. Why is it wrong to talk about if you believe in electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles then? Because the fuel cell vehicle is also electric vehicle. But this is the level where society is right now in the discussions.</p><p>So the starting point is always an electric propulsion of the vehicle, and then we're talking about electric motors, power electronics, electrified auxiliaries, and that has to be a perfect design solution. And then you design some kind of energy storage onboard. And there, you have to come up with a modular approach. Right now, the most promising technology when it comes to energy storage onboard a vehicle is batteries. No doubt about it. If you want to industrialize today, it's batteries. This might change definitely, but with our modular design, we are prepared today to take that change.</p><p>For example, dynamic on-road charging, electric highways or different kind of range extenders. It could be fuel cells, it could be gas turbines. And when or if fuel cells are mature enough to outcompete batteries in cost and in uptime, then the batteries will be replaced by hydrogen tanks and the fuel cells stack. That's the way we are thinking. That's the way we are treating the different options when it comes to onboard, energy storage and off-board energy storage.</p><p>And we have been conducting both research and testing of fuel cells for many years, and we will continue with that. We will even increase our efforts because we believe that in the long run, fuel cells can definitely be a viable technology, not the least for long-haul applications. But we believe that this will take a rather long time before it's high volume in fuel cell applications in our industry.</p><p>So yes, a lot of cool electric vehicles from the Volvo Group, but I can assure you that for many years, I will be at the Capital Markets Day talking about combustion engines. And this is cool for real. We need to develop -- continue to develop more energy-efficient solutions when it comes to combustion engines in order to stay competitive and not the least, also to fulfill upcoming very tough, stringent regulations in Europe, U.S., wherever in the world.</p><p>Europe, just recently, settled their legislative demand, minus 15%, 1-5, to 2025 and minus 30% to 2030 in CO2 reductions on our average annual fleets. Really tough demands, and approximately the same demands as we already have in U.S. The speed of these reductions is approximately 3x higher than what the industry has delivered over the past 20 years, 3x higher. Tough demands, yes. Really tough demands, but we have a clear view on what we need to do, what we need to do to secure that we are competitive and not only fulfilling regulations.</p><p>To illustrate that and to give you a flavor on how we are just working our industry, I brought a short video clip from a U.S. customer, Vlad. He's working with VTS Transportation, and he has got a couple of new Volvo VNL with the new turbo compound engine. So let's see what Vlad is saying about the new engines.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>LARS STENQVIST: I just love this guy. You don't typically understand, 10% is normal price, and we don't even get to smile back. It's 10%. You can just imagine if we would have promised that guy, 7.5% and delivered 5%, just imagine.</p><p>Well, the turbo compound engine from North America is now also being launched in Europe. Turbo compound is a technology where you're recovering energy from the exhaust gases through a turbine and then you just bring it back to the crankshaft. It's waste, heat recovery, free. The turbo compound unit and technology is only one of the reasons why this engine is so efficient. There are several different technologies that we have developed and implemented, and that's the way going forward as well because there is no silver bullet whatsoever. We have a long list of technologies that we are going to improve, and we're going to implement them gradually over the years in order to stay competitive and to meet upcoming regulations.</p><p>Combustion engine is, I call it, a versatile machine. With rather small adaptations, you can run it almost on any kind of fuel. Many of our customers are already using our combustion engines for different renewable alternative fuels, and we have extremely good experience now from our Volvo Trucks running on LNG, liquefied natural gas. The good thing with gas engines is that you automatically get a very good CO2 reduction. Just by running on gas, you can get up to minus 25%, an enormous step. And if the customers choose to run on liquefied biogas, then you're close to 100%.</p><p>I was into electrification of long haul before. And yes, fully electric, battery electric trucks for long hauls will come, but the in-between step will be hybrids combustion engines and then combined with mild hybrids or full hybrids where we are then recovering break energy and energy that you have in the vehicle when you go down a slope.</p><p>And by that, I plan to leave both electromobility and combustion technology. And even if I still define electromobility as one of the really new technologies, we dare to say when we are discussing this that from a business perspective, from what we're going to do, from what we are going to develop, we know rather well what we have upfront, what we have in front of us and what we need to do. If I change to another technology, if I change into automation, then there is much more uncertainties. Uncertainties when it comes to technologies but also uncertainties when it comes to business models. The benefits are all easy to understand if you talk about full autonomous vehicles: safety, energy efficiency, productivity for our customers.</p><p>There are different levels of automation. And when it comes to driver support functions, we are investing a lot, have been investing a lot since safety is in our DNA. And we have the Volvo Dynamic Steering as a unique feature in our group. The Volvo Dynamic Steering is an electric motor connected to the steering gear. And through very advanced sensors, we are comparing the intention of the driver, where is the driver trying to get the vehicle comparing that to where the vehicle really is heading or -- and that means that if you get irregularities from the road, for example, disturbing this, then the Volvo Dynamic Steering will compensate for that, meaning that the driver is just keeping a steady hand on the steering wheel, and the vehicle will compensate for all kind of disturbances.</p><p>This gives fantastic stability in high speeds, and the maneuverability low speeds is just amazing. This is a key -- once you have started to utilize the Volvo Dynamic Steering, then you'll never ever want to drive a vehicle without it. So that's examples of features that we have launched based on Volvo Dynamic Steering this year: remote control, lane keep assist and stability assist.</p><p>If you go to higher levels of automation, then all of a sudden, we come into the discussion of replacing the driver and the higher productivity. But it's definitely much more than just replacing the driver. If you think about it, the self-driving vehicle can operate 2 shifts, 3 shifts, 5 shifts, 24/7 principally, meaning that you can increase utilization of the vehicle, but also you can run it in a much smarter mode, less acceleration, less breaking, less idling, and by that, you can save a lot of fuel.</p><p>Also on this area, we have shown a lot of proof points since we met last year. Some of the proof points, we have publicly announced that we have 2 commercial pilots now for Volvo Trucks: the self-driving electric truck, Vera; and our self-driving trucks in Br\u00c3\u00b8nn\u00c3\u00b8y, Norway. You're going to hear more about that later.</p><p>UD Trucks has demonstrated high-level automation on the UD Quon, now in discussions with partners about next step. Volvo Buses are shown as self-driving electric city bus here in our Gothenburg and together with the University in Singapore. This bus is intended to be utilized at the university campus in Singapore and also then at the bus depot in the evenings. Think about it, the bus can go to the washing station on its own, the bus can go to the charging station on its own, and then after it, it can go park itself. Opens up a lot of possibilities.</p><p>Volvo Penta shown a self-docking yacht. It could be something for all of you, yacht electrification. Target for Bj\u00c3\u00b6rn and team is to launch it next year. But perhaps, if there is anyone interested in field testing, it could be a possibility.</p><p>Our first application when it comes to really self-driving vehicles like Br\u00c3\u00b8nn\u00c3\u00b8y in Norway, like Electric Site, that's what we call confined areas. In those confined, closed areas, we're working with geofencing, making sure that we have control of the environment 100%. In those areas, we have also, of course, 100% responsibility for the safety of the vehicles. But in a confined area, it's rather easy to control the environment. And there, we have developed in-house all the stuff needed for the autonomous driving system.</p><p>But now when we take next steps, now when we go on-road, then we need more -- we need much more sophisticated systems, and that's the reason why Jan was on stage here today earlier, that's the reason why Martin and Jan this morning announced our partnership with NVIDIA. NVIDIA is, for me, a world-class company when it comes to accelerated computing and artificial intelligence. We have been talking to each now for years. We have been working together during the years. And now, we said, now it's time to formalize this cooperation and tell the world what we are doing. Amazing company, amazing people. Engineering-driven company, making own money that they are reinvesting into new technologies, rather similar to us to bonus. And that's why it's easy for my engineers to work together with the NVIDIA guys because we share some kind of common DNA.</p><p>Together, we will develop what we call automated driving system, the decision-making layer, center in this slide. But that's not sufficient if you really want to be good in autonomous driving. You also need to have what we have to the left, the redundant base vehicle. The vehicle need to be able to operate also if the primary brake system is out of order or the steering system is out of order. But on top of that, if you think about it, if you're going to operate the self-driving truck 25 meters long, 60 ton, then it's rather good if you know your breaking performance at any time, at any kind of road condition. It's rather good if you are good at knowing what's their maximum speed that you can allow yourself before you go into the next curve. And then you come into this -- or you're really coming to the DNA of our engineers, the vehicle dynamics. That's really our profession, and that's where we are going to bring a lot of knowledge into this cooperation.</p><p>Quality and uptime will be extremely important. As I said before, these vehicles cannot operate 24/7. And there will be no driver checking the tires, checking the vehicle, meaning that we need to be even better with remote diagnostics in order to make sure that the vehicles are in good shape. It's not about vehicles only. We also need to connect them to a control tower, to other vehicles and to the logistic system of the customers.</p><p>Automation is very much about connectivity. But connectivity on its own has also a lot of potential, and we are talking about almost 1 million connected vehicles right now. One million vehicles. The data those vehicles are creating is an enabler for new services.</p><p>And when you talk about connectivity, I think it's rather easy for everyone to understand that the data generated right now, as we speak, is an asset for this company. We're talking about those vehicles constantly and rating information on where they are, speed, status of different components, fuel consumption and many, many, many more parameters. You have earlier seen today the potential we have when it comes to service business. And through intelligent use of this data and launching new services, we have a golden opportunity to close this untapped potential in services.</p><p>All in all today, we have the possibility to monitor components in our vehicles and to judge if they are close to breakdown. And you can just imagine when our guys working at Uptime Center is giving a call to a customer, just imagine. \"Hello, this is Uptime Center calling you. We think that there is a risk that your vehicle will break down within the upcoming weeks. Well, we don't know for sure, but we see it as a rather big risk. If you're interested, you can come into a service workshop, and we can have a look at your vehicle.\"</p><p>What's your guess? Do you think we get a lot of \"no's\" to that question? No. And sometimes, it's a false alarm. And then we say it was a false alarm, we have reset the fault codes or whatsoever or we changed a component and then they're on the road again. And this is building loyalty, and this is building business and it's building trust. Those customers, they will definitely consider us when it's time to make the next purchase of new vehicles. And applying artificial intelligence is now what we are doing to this in order to find out patterns of wear of different components in order to be better in the diagnostics of when are they going to break down.</p><p>That's not only when it comes to Uptime Centers. There's another area as well. The connectivity goes in 2 ways. We are not reading -- only reading out vehicles, we're also updating vehicles. A lot of the features in the vehicles today are controlled by software. And when my engineers are releasing a new version, it can mean a lot of benefits for the customers. In the past, when a customer needed to go to a Volvo workshop or a Renault workshop or a Mack workshop to get an update, it could take hours. Today, we can do it over there while they are having lunch. And this is definitely a service that our customers are willing to pay for.</p><p>In North America, we have both for Volvo and Mack brand the service that we call Parameter Plus. It's a subscription model where the customers are paying for getting up to 250 parameters updated with the latest integrated software. This is only the start.</p><p>And coming back to artificial intelligence and data analytics, we're using it more and more internally. First, we thought about it from a customer and service perspective. But from an R&amp;D perspective, in order to maximize the output of the R&amp;D organization, in order to optimize the different solutions, if you think about it, for us as human beings, it's hard to analyze more than 2 or 3 parameters. But computers have no limits. They can analyze relations between 8,000 parameters or 10,000 parameters or 100,000 parameters and come up with smart answers. Here, we're opening doors that we didn't even know existed a few years ago. This will increase our capabilities in research and development.</p><p>I said in the beginning that speed is increasing. I said in the beginning that the world around us is more complex than ever, and we see clearly that we cannot solve everything on our own. Partnerships will be key. What we announced with NVIDIA today is one big step, but there will be more to come in the months after vacation. We have also decided that we need to have a new way of working. That's why we inaugurated what we call CampX a couple of months ago.</p><p>The first CampX is in Gothenburg. It's an innovation arena where we have co-located engineers in electromobility, automation, connectivity; 450 experts in the areas of engineering, business development, purchasing and legal. By that, we are increasing our internal speed, but that's not the most important here. We have also reserved -- rather, matched office space here together with our engineers where we are inviting external partners to co-locate with us.</p><p>And that's partners like NVIDIA, big tech companies, it's start-up companies, it's medium-sized suppliers, it's academia, it's authorities, it's even customers sitting together with us. And just after a couple of months, my teams are complaining they are sold out, no more place. They need to -- so we decided that week that we will increase CampX consult in Gothenburg and most likely also go globally into other sites. We have a lot of partners in big projects, and we have a lot of partners already now in CampX in small collaborations. This is the new way of working, open up for collaboration and innovation in an open and honest way.</p><p>I started saying that the future is changing faster than ever, and our answer to that is to increase our speed. I also said in the beginning that this is the era of engineering, and I dare to say that my advice remains, if you want to advise your children, then engineering is a good choice. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you, Lars. And with that, we'll take a quick 30-minute break and reconvene in here, 2:45, please. There will be coffee and drinks outside the doors, up there. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: So hello, everyone, again. And good sign. It seems that most of you have found the way back off the break also, so that is good KPI. We will actually continue now with as we have also now the very important and interesting session and that is around 4 use cases of the future technologies that we have been discussing or, as a matter of fact, technologies that we are partly also already using and we're accelerating. And just as a small introduction that we have discussed already or you have heard from me and from Lars, but a number of key things that we are discussing together with our partners and customers are the following.</p><p>First and foremost that when we are thinking about the new technologies, it's not about the new technologies per se. It's really about finding common grounds for what is the outcomes that we would like to have in terms of environmental performance, safety, productivity, obviously, and different factors to really outline that together. And that can only be done through in-depth application knowledge. And when we said before that we are moving beyond the era of average and the scale in the wrong dimension, hopefully, you will hear around that also during these 4 use cases how we are actually going into depth about working together in the specific environment application, geography, legislation environment or what have you.</p><p>We have been talking about the need of having the best partnerships in the industry that goes upstreams, it goes horizontal and it goes downstreams. And that is also another proof point of this cases. The CAST system, obviously, for the new technologies mean that we can utilize the backbone, both of hardware, software developments and steal -- and get, so to speak, the very specific needs for every use and customer case.</p><p>And iterative development together with customers, more and more important. I mean the heritage of our industry has been okay, secret, secret, secret. Nothing to say. I mean I remember the first sentence I learned 30 years ago when I was starting in this industry was are you launching a new product, and then the answer was the following. \"We are a company that is constantly developing our products and services. And when we are launching something new, we have the reason to come back to you.\" That will not work anymore because if you're really about to launch something, you must iterate it, do it quick and agile and do it with customers in real use cases.</p><p>What do we mean by commercial pilot approach? Yes, in order to get things going, you need to pilot and see how it's working in different environments but rather quickly after that, accelerate that into a scalable solution. And that's the reason why we are combining that commercial pilot approach with the speed to market to see if that is working. And it will be a constant, so to speak, iteration between okay, not working, that is not the right thinking when it comes to the flow of the business model, develop a new one or test a new one, et cetera. So have that in mind and that is how we are thinking about it as a group together with our partners when we are going through these 4 use cases.</p><p>And the first one we will start with is actually on the bus side. Buses have been leading the development, obviously, in urban areas when it comes to electrification, the system thinking. That is about CO2 performance. It is about nonspeculative matters. And it is about having, so to speak, an attractive system.</p><p>It will be Jan Kilstr\u00c3\u00b6m who is the CEO of Keolis, one of the biggest operators in the European arena and also a person that I happen to know very well. We have been -- having the chance to be working in different angles, actually, during our careers. Together with H\u00c3\u00a5kan Agnevall, who is the President of Volvo Buses, that we'll pursue a conversation around this topic. But we'll start with a small introduction here.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a5KAN AGNEVALL, PRESIDENT, VOLVO BUSSAR AB: Good. Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. It's a great privilege to be here. H\u00c3\u00a5kan Agnevall, President of Volvo Buses. And it's a fantastic privilege to have you, Jan, here.</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: Thank you, H\u00c3\u00a5kan. Yes. My name is Jan Kilstr\u00c3\u00b6m, and I'm heading the Swedish part of the Keolis organization.</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a5KAN AGNEVALL: So you could see a little bit what the focus is in the bus industry. It's a major transformation. From Volvo, we focus on system solutions: 0 noise, 0 congestion, 0 accidents, 0 emission. A lot of zeros to create the future sustainable cities. And Jan, Keolis.</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: Yes. First of all, I have to be a little bit rude perhaps. Martin, I have to correct you a little bit. We're not just a European player. We are present in India, we are present in Australia and we're present in the North America. Keolis is a group leader. I would say, leader in public transport. We have a turnover of about EUR 5 billion, EUR 6 billion. But I think the most important number is that we have 22,000 buses. And we need good cooperation to get those buses work well and specifically also, develop in a way that the whole industry is now developing. Just an example, we have 20 ongoing test setups in about 6 different countries regarding autonomous vehicle setups. And that is one of the things that we need to work further on, I would say.</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a5KAN AGNEVALL: So basically, coming back to what Lars said, the coming 10 years, we will see more changes in public transport than in the previous 30, 40 years. And it's all driven by autonomous, electromobility and connectivity. These 3 technologies that are kind of converging right here, right now and creating great opportunities to create a sustainable public transport of the future.</p><p>And if we start with electromobility, when we started out the journey, it was a lot about reducing emission. We learned on the way the value of noise. So what started with our quality then converted into changed way of planning cities. Because when you have a transport mode that is silent and emission-free, you can bring public transport much closer to people and you can bring it indoors. And by that, you can really start to plan cities in a different way.</p><p>And then the third way where change that will come is then when the cities have these huge amount of electric buses, it actually becomes a component in your power system for the city. A component that the city can leverage and work with as part -- as an integral part of its power system. So it's new horizons.</p><p>Of course, as an OEM, as a bus OEM, this also means a completely new way of working. Because it's really, truly a system. It's not only the buses, the charting infrastructure, it's the cooperation with several different stakeholders. And we are all new in the technology, and we all need to find reliable and sustainable systems. And we have been working very closely with Keolis, both here in Sweden where we have a very close relationship, you would talk more about that, but also on an international arena.</p><p>So can you tell a little bit more about the cooperation and how -- what we have been developing?</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: Yes. I think over the years, you could say that we have had a good cooperation. We have had some test runs. We have had -- very early, we had hybrid buses. And I'd like to give you some credit here because Volvo was very early shifting over to electrical solutions. They gave up the gas engines a little bit because you saw that something else was coming in the future. And to be honest, if you look at the tenders that are coming out now from the public transport authorities, it's so focused now on electrical solutions. So I think that's worthwhile saying.</p><p>But I would like to highlight one other thing, and you almost mentioned it, and that is it's a big transformation right now in the whole public transport sector. Politicians want to have all the new solutions. They want to have electricity. And we, as operators, even though we are -- the company is sort of -- there are 65,000 employees, we don't know really what to do because there are so many different things out there. There are test setups, and we don't really know what will be the, let's say, the business model for the future and so forth. And maybe you'll say, \"Well, you are the operator, figure that out.\" But I'm saying, \"No, I need help.\" I think the industry from the OEM side needs to also come -- we need you to help us to set this up and to come up with this because it's a little bit of a waiting game right now.</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a5KAN AGNEVALL: And that ties back to knowing your industry vertical. So of course, we don't have all the answers to Jan's problem. But working together, we can find out the way forward. And I think this is key. Also, with electromobility, if we look at that as the technology, it is a system, and you cannot only put a large set of electrical buses and operation in the city. You need to involve more stakeholders. You need to involve the utilities. You need to involve the mayor's office, traffic planners, et cetera. And this is something that we are developing as Volvo Buses, a kind of project system business capability, both on the business development side, the sales side, but also on the project execution side.</p><p>And the customer interface and relation is very much about cooperation. And then we also want to -- because there are so many competitors in the arena of electric buses, but then we go back to the kind of the Volvo DNA: safety, quality, environmental care, providing a premium bus or a premium vehicle with premium services.</p><p>And what really is important, even with new technology, because we need to move out of piloting, is uptime reliability, a fantastic service that people can rely on. And a little bit going back to line 55 that we have had here in Gothenburg, it's a pilot, commercial pilot that we actually did together. What is your experience so far? We've been running this now for 4 years.</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: Well, it's -- we have very good experiences. And when you go out and ask the -- both the passengers and the drivers, they like it. We even can see that passenger says -- well, I think it's 1 out of 3, says, \"I'm willing to pay more money for this type of setup.\" And that's very encouraging. And the drivers, they like the way no vibration, no noise. So overall, I think the outcome has been very good. And also, from a quality point of view, we can see some good results. So I think this is something that we need to take one more step.</p><p>And I just want to at least also a little bit sort of challenge you, we would like to see more of those kind of tests because we need to come proactively to our customers and say this is the setup we would like to test together with, for example, Volvo. And then that could be incorporated in a solution further on somewhere else. So that's the way to work together, but this is a very good example.</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a5KAN AGNEVALL: Then we move on to autonomous, very strong coming in public transport as well. The message from Volvo and Volvo Buses, it's a step-by-step approach. It's a lot about driver support now.</p><p>Depot operation, that would be a kind of industry vertical that we will focus on. Only later will come operations running and separate the traffic. And even later, operations running in a mix of public and -- I mean, human run and machine run. Because the technology is evolving very rapidly, but it's still challenging applications.</p><p>And as a bus operation, we have a fantastic asset of -- in being part of Volvo Group. I mean as a bus operator, we could never do this ourselves. But we can really leverage the Volvo Group platforms in all these 3 technology areas and also leveraging the scales of our trucks colleagues. So that for me gives me a fantastic confidence of Volvo as a bus provider for the future.</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: Maybe it's worthwhile mentioning that we have an upcoming project together, where we are going to look at the depot in Gothenburg to see if we can get autonomous transport from the depot parking into the service hall and from the service hall back again. It seems simple, but it's very, very interesting to see that happening now.</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a5KAN AGNEVALL: And also for us as Volvo to cooperate with a global player like Keolis, it's a fantastic advantage. Because the solutions that we develop, and I would say, even within Keolis, I think you are recognized as one of the champions in the group. We do it here in Sweden, Gothenburg and then we scale it all over the world.</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: Yes. We have the best possible sort of conditions as well with such -- I mean there are -- you have Volvo here, we have Scania here, so it's a good ground to start from.</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a5KAN AGNEVALL: Thanks a lot. Thank you.</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: Thank you, H\u00c3\u00a5kan. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Yes. I think before you are allowed to leave the stage, I think maybe one thing that a lot of people are sitting here and wondering about is, is it profitable today to install, so to speak, a bus -- a public bus transport system that is fully electrical? What do you say, Jan?</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: I think the jury is still out on that. But if you look at the tenders that are out here now, it will definitely be profitable. It's just that it's another type of -- it's a heavier investment in the beginning. But then you get it back at a later stage. So I would say that it's going to be profitable. I'm a little bit concerned about the quality, for example. I'm a little bit concerned about how long will the battery run, those kind of things. But as soon as we get that under control, it will be profitable.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: And I think that is part of the game. I want to take your words there, but I mean for us really to be able to provide also that security in terms of battery replacement and things, but I think that seriously is a...</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: Yes, I agree.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: And by the way, it's encouraging to hear Jan saying that it will definitely be profitable because one of the key things that we have found, if you take the societal benefits for cities, that is a [without a doubt sort of thing]. Anything you would like to add, H\u00c3\u00a5kan, on that?</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a5KAN AGNEVALL: No, I think it's profitable. It's also, driven by regulatory measures. So it's a combination. Because I think -- I have the privilege to meet the mayors in the world, traveling the world and talk about sustainable public transport. And I would say there is one topic that is on the top of the agenda of any mayor in the world and that is air quality and the need to grow a sustainable transport. So I think the big shift is coming. And we are 25%, 30% -- 35% into the business for sure.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Absolutely. Great. Thank you very much, Jan. Thank you</p><p>JAN KILSTR\u00c3\u00b6M; KEOLIS SVERIGE; CEO: Thank you.</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a5KAN AGNEVALL: Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Very good. So now we're getting started and we are going to the next area, and that is actually our beautiful Vera. Mikael Karlsson, who is the Vice President of Autonomous Solutions within Volvo Trucks, will give a presentation what Vera will do as part of the first assignment. So a small team to make the introduction here and then you will meet Mikael.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>MIKAEL KARLSSON, VP AUTONOMOUS SOLUTIONS AT VOLVO TRUCKS, AB VOLVO (PUBL): So that was Vera taking her first assignment, and I'm proud to be here presenting this new autonomous solution that we are doing not so far away from here actually. If you're a good golfer, maybe it's -- or a very good golfer, it's maybe a couple of par 5s or you can take an electric bus with H\u00c3\u00a5kan, then it's 5 minutes. So it's in the port area of Gothenburg. It's on a pretty defined route, a 10-kilometer repetitive flow with quite large volumes of goods and relatively short distance. And this is the typical prereqs that is needed for installing an autonomous solution.</p><p>Autonomous solution does not work for everyone everywhere. The same way, I would say, as in manufacturing. What we have seen within manufacturing also applies to autonomous solutions. So if you have a repetitive flow, high volumes, it makes sense to invest in what we can say a prolonged production flow that we call also an autonomous solution. So this is what we will do here in Gothenburg in a commercial pilot.</p><p>In a production flow, you get different benefits as well. And Lars, I think, has talked before about the different TCO, total customer ownership, that is on the cost side. We also have on the value side the same benefits as you see in the production front. You see productivity gains through delivery precision, through flexibility and not at least safety, and that, I think, will be very hard to compete against. When we have installed an autonomous solution for a predefined route, it will be a quite tempting business case to operate in.</p><p>We have also talked about driving prosperity through collaboration and collaboration is the new leadership. Partnership is the new way of working. We revealed the very nice cooperation and partnership with NVIDIA. We have also taken a strategic direction on the outbound side, you can say, on the commercial side to partner with strong players in order to learn faster and to be able to scale quicker and in a more relevant cases.</p><p>So this is what we have done here. We had partnered with DFDS who is a strong ferry and logistics company. And together, we will build a transport solution, finding out the benefits and potential hurdles of this new solution.</p><p>And we will listen to Torben, who is the CEO of DFDS, when he explains the benefits of working together with Volvo.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>MIKAEL KARLSSON: So DFDS is the main collaboration partner to start with. But there are more and we will reveal more as time goes by.</p><p>If we look in autonomous solution as such, what we're offering, it's quite different to what we're offering in our normal performing business. We are shooting for a solution business. We will not only provide vehicles, we will provide a solution. That said, we will not do everything ourselves. We will partner in different areas. We are strong in vehicles, obviously. We need control towers and we've also seen to that before, not only for controlling the vehicle flow but also for integrating into the customer logistics systems.</p><p>We are also running operations and Br\u00c3\u00b8nn\u00c3\u00b8y is the next example. We will come back on that.</p><p>Maintenance and repair obviously needs to be included as well. We need to have smart payment solutions since there are no people involved in the transport. There needs to be some infrastructure adapted like gates and other digital solutions.</p><p>And all in all, we get autonomous transport solution that would be provided to new customers.</p><p>Speaking about customers, we have a quite long list of customers that are already interested in working together with us in these different solutions. These are not normally the type of customers that we have had. It's customers' customer, you can say more. It's the -- those who have the transport need, it's big ports, it's big logistics center, it's big sort of providers of logistics that are typically the customers that are contacting us and wants to work further with us.</p><p>So autonomous business, it's a progressive journey. It's a collaboration both on the enabling side and on the customer side. And we are here to win. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you, Mikael. And before you are leaving the stage, maybe one follow-up question. When we looked at Vera here, she was running rather softly, not maybe the highest speed. What is your thinking about that?</p><p>MIKAEL KARLSSON: I think we have safety as our core value and in our DNA, so we are starting in a way, starting to walk before we run. So we are starting in these kind of segments where we believe it makes sense both from a safety perspective and from a commercial perspective. And we have put the speed limit today of Vera for 40 kilometers per hour, but...</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Which is not a technical speed limit, but...</p><p>MIKAEL KARLSSON: No, it's not a technical speed limit, but it's a speed limit where we start to feel that the braking distance and everything will be handleable.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: But I think that is an important message also, I mean, to really get to the flows where, I mean, it's more the continuous flow that matters rather than if it's a 40 or 60 kilometers, for example.</p><p>MIKAEL KARLSSON: Yes. I mean -- but we will be able to run 24/7. We will be able to run consistently. So the productivity will anyway be quite well improved.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Exactly. So when do we get to start here?</p><p>MIKAEL KARLSSON: We already started.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Yes, I know that, but when will we have the next Capital Markets Day with Vera.</p><p>MIKAEL KARLSSON: Let's come back on when we're already in full operation. But this is definitely one of the segments that we are ramping up.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you, Mikael. Very good example as well.</p><p>Now we're actually moving into the space of construction equipment. Some of you have seen and heard about the electric side. I just briefly mentioned that. We will have Gustaf Werner, who is Head of Nordics when it comes to industrial solutions within Skanska; and Per-Erik Lindstr\u00c3\u00b6m, actually Senior Vice President, Volvo Trucks. And up to recently, the key account head for construction equipment on the global accounts, including then Skanska and some of the other big players, but it also shows good mobility within the group that we are nurturing good talent.</p><p>So we start with a small movie here as well and then you will see the gentlemen up the stage here.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Gustaf, every time I see this movie, I really get proud and I get goosebumps. So it's really, really cool.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: Yes, it's really great. It's really great. And it's great to be here. I'm the main head of the asphalt and aggregate business at -- in Skanska in the Nordics, mainly Finland and Norway. So this is one of the parts of the project that I have been really working together with you with in a collaboration. And take -- to take the full part as a construction company like Skanska who's a major player in the U.S., in the U.K., in Central Europe and in the Nordics, we really are pushing also the emission-free perspective. But all the sustainability area, how to actually reach those goals in a better way.</p><p>But we started, when we discussed this, how to actually work with the quarry business to start with what we've called an area which can control the business. So what you see on the screen right now is actually how a quarry or classic quarry works, so I will lead you through it.</p><p>If you look at the left-hand side, you see the crusher. That's the crusher and it's been fed by an excavator. So what you say, what's the fuel consumption on an excavator?</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M, SVP OF VOLVO TRUCKS, AB VOLVO (PUBL): Depending on the brand, of course. But if it's Volvo, it's about 40 liters an hour in this size class.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: Yes. Sure, okay. And then we crush the -- with a crusher and the crusher has approximately fuel consumption about...</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: Now this one has a penta diesel, so it's about 45, 50 liters. So all of it, depending on the...</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: So 100 -- 200 liters per hour. And then we have the wheel loader that you see on the -- from outside here that's loading the haulers. And then from the primary crusher, we take to the secondary crusher to refine the material. So when you take those machines, what fuel consumptions do you have there?</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: Yes. So if we take the wheel loader, typically, in this application, it's about 50 tonne, 40, 45, 50. And then we have the rigids here. It's 3 rigids, big ones, and they are also taking like 50, 60 liters an hour so...</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: So in total, how many -- in 1 hour, how many -- how much liters do we actually...</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: And now you put me on the spot here, but I'd say close to 400 liters, I think.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: Yes, it's quite a lot. And the initial discussions we have had is actually how to lower the fuel consumption. But when we started this we see that, okay, could you do something else? We think about outside the box and trying to do something really different. So we put up really tough targets on the CO2 emission, on the energy perspective, but also on safety and the noise perspective, actually how we work. So we went from this kind of classic quarry to something else. And what's that?</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: Yes. So this is actually the Electric Site. Just a quick go-through, that we actually electrified everything which was possible, from the crusher to the excavator. And we had a hybrid wheel loader, which Lars was talking about earlier today. And then we also redefined the hauling solution. Remember that the classic way is 3 big ones. But with the disruptive technologies, we realized we can do this smarter. We can, as we take out operator, we can have more machines, actually more vehicles because we don't depend on the operators, which also gives an effect that we can reduce the fuel -- the energy consumption are going smaller and also creating a higher redundancy in the production system. So we have 8 machines instead of 3, that is -- if someone goes down in the classical, you only have 67% of your capacity; if someone goes down here, you have 87.5%.</p><p>I think also what we found out was related to increased safety. Because if you think of a traditional quarry, there are lots of erratic vehicle movements. But here, even though the machines are smart, but they are quite foolish because we have to tell them what they are doing. And by telling them, we need to think in advance how this logistical flow will look like. And by that, we can reducing really safety concerns.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: Sure. And when we look at the result, what we did was that we created a test, a full-scale test during the autumn, this fall last year and then we tested the -- all the system. And we reached those goals. The goals that we set was 95% of reducing CO2 emission. We actually reached 98%. That's really good.</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: Yes.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: And actually with this, we have the -- from approximately how much liters do we have, 400 liters or something, down to 64 per hour.</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: Oh, actually, it was even better. It was 3.3 cubic meters per day and we went down to 64 liters a day. And that's fantastic.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: And that -- and we didn't use HVO or biodiesel. If you use that, we can actually decrease that even more.</p><p>If you looked at the energy cost, with this type of 3,300 liters of diesel, reduce it down to just 64 liters, but we changed it to energy. But if you calculate those 3,300 liters, it's approximately 33,000-kilowatt hours on one shift. And then we went down to almost 9,000-kilowatt hours per shift. So the increase of productivity was quite extraordinary as well.</p><p>So we reduced the energy cost quite a lot with 70%. And then the operator's cost, we reduced the staffing of course. And we shifted from competence actually to drive and control the machines instead.</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: Exactly, exactly.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: And come back to that carbon emission. Actually, when you calculate these, a lot of cubics of diesel that you consume every day is actually almost 9,000 tons per day. And we went down to 166 kilos per day. So it's really beneficial for the environment.</p><p>So what do we do next? Do I get this for the show?</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: Yes, exactly. Exactly. That's really the challenge. So what we actually are doing now within Volvo CE that we're breaking apart the Electric Site as such so we can focusing on continue developing the wheel loaders, continue developing the excavators and we like to continue to developing the autonomous, what we call the HX solution. Because like Mikael was talking about earlier, this is a solution.</p><p>And of course, we are now using all the knowledge within the group. That goes without saying, of course, we're working tight together with our colleagues here. Then, of course, we're using external partners. Of course, that Volvo CE will get used of all the partnership which was just presented today and continue working with academia. Because the good thing is that we are also creating a buzz around our brand and the talents really want to join us, which is a great effort because there's a war out there to getting a hold of all the good talents.</p><p>And of course, we will continue to ramp up. I mean we are in very good discussions with you, Gustaf, how we can explore this further and get to commercialization. But of course, we're also working in the other different verticals market. We're talking about different segments. So all where there's a need for a repetitive transport solution, we're looking into that now and working with other customers and partners. And so we really put a stake in the ground and we're really focusing hard on this going forward.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: Yes. And if you look at this, this is 1 quarter that we did the test. Skanska has approximately 100 quarries in Sweden. The industry has 1,200 queries in Sweden. And if we electrify it and we work with these kind of machines, it's really making change.</p><p>Because we talked a lot about the potential in the market, the growing market for the future, and that's actually business for Skanska and also business for Volvo. But it also comes with a lot of responsibility, how we work with this in the future, because we are part of the problem but we're also really part of the solution to create this for the future.</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: And talking about attractiveness in the partnership, also what we have showcased here during the fall here has created a lot of attention to Volvo Group from customers which we actually don't have so much relationship with today. So someone was joking that there was a line outside my booth, that people want to come and talk to us. And that's pretty cool, I must say. So Gustaf, what do you say?</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: Great job.</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: Great job.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: Yes, absolutely. Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you, Gustaf and Per-Erik. Maybe just some follow-up question. What I thought was very interesting with this project, not because we -- only because we see these fantastic benefits and opportunities moving ahead, but most of all, so the learning from the 2 organizations. Because for me, Skanska is sitting on -- is a project-based organization basically. You're running everything in projects and solutions. I mean, you have your site that you should construct. You're constructing P&amp;L around that, et cetera. And you got a hold of some other findings, I mean, when it comes to competence, when it comes to people, et cetera. Can you elaborate?</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: Absolutely. And we try -- it's quite early because we have worked with this since 2014. And quite early, we recognized that could we collaborate in different areas as well. So we started discussing this VPS mobile production system, how can we take benefit from that as well in Skanska someday. We have started that. But also, we started with Melker's unit with Volvo CE HR initiatives where we have 10 peers from Skanska and then from Volvo CE that meets together and talking about the future, what can be developed together in a better way.</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: And I think that it also tells us that when you're going into partnership, 1 plus 1 is not 2, it's 3 and more. And then when we came up with this idea about HR, I mean we didn't thought that before. But then we were chitchatting and then we realized, maybe we can do something in the HR community. And then we engaged with Diana and others and then we got there and we launched it to you and my boss and he said, that's...</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: No. But as you say, Gustaf, and I think this is a key ability for -- that we need to get hold of now, how do we scale this, to your point. I mean it's good enough to do 1 or 5 or 10 but if we are to change, I mean, the footprints moving forward and do that in a profitable way, we actually need to install a couple of hundreds per year. We'll be headed up in another event a couple of weeks ago. Thank you very much for the presentation. Good progress.</p><p>PER-ERIK LINDSTR\u00c3\u00b6M: Thank you.</p><p>GUSTAF WERNER; SKANSKA INDUSTRIAL SOLUTIONS; HEAD OF NORDICS: Great. Thanks.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: And then we are moving to the last one and that is also coming even closer to commercialization. We are about to commercialize this now during the year also, the Electric Site, but where we already have the ink on the paper, we have put the stick on the ground and we have put harder promises when it comes to fully automated solutions. It is in Norway with Br\u00c3\u00b6nn\u00c3\u00b6y Kalk. So please welcome Raymond and Sasko to present it. But maybe we should start with a small movie again so we are keeping the traditions here.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>SASKO CUKLEV, DIRECTOR AUTONOMOUS SOLUTIONS AT VOLVO TRUCKS, AB VOLVO (PUBL): Hello, everyone. Great to be here and share a little bit about what we are doing together with Br\u00c3\u00b6nn\u00c3\u00b6y Kalk. So my name Sasko Cuklev, I am Director, Autonomous Solutions, at Volvo Trucks, and I'm extremely happy to have Managing Director, Raymond Langfjord, here with me today.</p><p>RAYMOND LANGFJORD; BR\u00c3\u00b6NN\u00c3\u00b6Y KALK; MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thank you.</p><p>SASKO CUKLEV: I will start with taking a bit into the future, but not that far ahead. So let's peek into this coming winter. Then Volvo Trucks autonomous mining solution will be in operation and we will get paid per transported tonne. Then 7 FH16 trucks will in rough mining conditions transport limestone from the mine to a nearby port and this will be done autonomously.</p><p>These 7 trucks, together with the site management system, service and support, workshop setup, insurances, payment models, et cetera, will be packaged into one solution, and this solution will be Volvo's first commercial autonomous solution in real operation. And it is happening now. So we could say that the future is already here.</p><p>Already mentioned a couple of time, both from Martin and Lars and Mikael, we took a strategic decision -- or I should do like this as well -- we took a strategic decision to go for a commercial pilot approach. Meaning that we are partnering up with a customer. We are implementing a solution in a real case and we do that based on the customer's input and needs. We jointly agree on a feasible date and time we should start to operate. And then we iteratively developed a solution together with the customer with that date as a target.</p><p>And when I say developed a solution, I mean both the technical and the commercial aspects. And it's very important that they are driven in parallel.</p><p>Further, it is very much about collaboration. So constantly sharing about problems, challenges, successes. And then it is very important for us to partner up with a customer that we can share rewards with as well as risks.</p><p>So according to me, the Br\u00c3\u00b8nn\u00c3\u00b8y implementation has -- or is a great example of a successful commercial pilot implementation. But who am I to say that this is a success? So let's ask the customer. So Raymond, please share your view.</p><p>RAYMOND LANGFJORD; BR\u00c3\u00b6NN\u00c3\u00b6Y KALK; MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thank you, Sasko, and thank you very much for inviting me.</p><p>In November, December 2015, we sent out a lot of emails to many companies. On December 17 at 19:52 in the evening, the email went to Volvo. And here we are.</p><p>Going a bit quickly forward. What we saw after a while with Volvo was that we share values, safety, quality and environmental care. And why are we doing this? We are competing in a tough industry -- global industry and the cost level in Norway is high. So new technology is how we are able to be -- survive in the future.</p><p>And I'll give you a couple of examples, what we get with this solution. Improved efficiency, improved productivity and flexibility.</p><p>Two things that we see now, and I will say that's on the first row here, that's what we see now. When we look at availability for maintenance on the crusher, looking in a 4-week period, today, we have 6 full shifts available for maintenance. We don't need to talk about shifts anymore. And when we look at availability for maintenance tomorrow, we can talk about 20 shifts on daytime under good site conditions, and that's a huge increase.</p><p>And let's say another thing with flexibility. When the stockpile is full, I -- you can relate to this. When the stockpile is full, what do you do? Well, you have to stop. But what then do you do? Well, you just stop the solution.</p><p>And I think that -- let -- my view on this project and I am going to say this with the utmost respect. When we started, we got behind the first level. So on carry-on, we didn't talk about finance. We were only talking about the solution. The solution, solution, solution was always in focus. And for a long period of time, there was this gentlemen's agreement between us. And I know that somebody was pushing down your neck and also my neck. We need to sign something now. But we went on for a long time and it was trust.</p><p>Has it been a success? Yes, I think so. And if I am to take away some key takeaways, I want to go back to trust. There were no hidden agendas. There was only focusing on solutions. And I used to believe that trust is something that you earn. But trust is something that you choose and there to give, and we both chose trust.</p><p>SASKO CUKLEV: Thank you, Raymond. It's great to hear your words. I always get emotional about this. We have been working hard.</p><p>So what is ahead of us then? What are the next steps? I mean, first of all, of course, the full focus will be on implementing the Br\u00c3\u00b8nn\u00c3\u00b8y solution. And after that, the intention is to start scaling up within the mining segment.</p><p>And we are, as we speak, in the initial stages of kicking off customer implementation #2 and 3. You can also share that many of the major mining players, mining customers are in contact with us, very interested in our approach and working together with us.</p><p>We are also looking into other segments, both confined area segments as well as public road segments. And I mean, Mikael Karlsson, you were up here, explained about the Vera pilot, which is one great example of another segment that we're working on.</p><p>Time is flying.</p><p>To summarize, if I would get the question to highlight the key success factor for an implementation like this, I would say it is all about the customer relationship. Thank you very much, Raymond, for being here, and thank you all for listening.</p><p>RAYMOND LANGFJORD; BR\u00c3\u00b6NN\u00c3\u00b6Y KALK; MANAGING DIRECTOR: Thank you very much.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: So here we are a little bit more clear on the time schedule. So since, Raymond, you were very precise on the email when you sent it out to us, so I imagine that you will be equally precise when it comes to measuring when we should get started here. So what is that time plan on getting started in real -- we have tested obviously now. But to start the real production, so to speak?</p><p>RAYMOND LANGFJORD; BR\u00c3\u00b6NN\u00c3\u00b6Y KALK; MANAGING DIRECTOR: We are testing, one truck is on site and we will continue testing throughout the year. And I would say later this winter.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Yes, later this winter, we are getting real operations. So maybe, that can compete with also being on the next Capital Markets Day to have to be in Norway and visit you at Br\u00c3\u00b6nn\u00c3\u00b6y Kalk.</p><p>RAYMOND LANGFJORD; BR\u00c3\u00b6NN\u00c3\u00b6Y KALK; MANAGING DIRECTOR: You're more than welcome.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you very much. Thank you.</p><p>So I hope that you have got a feel about what we started this part of the Capital Markets Day. I mean really building on strong partnerships, choosing the right application and verticals with the maturity level that we are into now when it comes to this type of automation solutions but also of course in electrification. That is a more mature business. And then, obviously, to have the customer base that we are fortunate to have that you can work with and to develop it together because this will be a continuous development. But we already see great potentials.</p><p>But I'm very pleased also. And I was maybe one of those pressing a little bit on that. Because my firm belief is that we need to stick, so to speak, the feet and the body into the cold water and work on it so we see the revenue streams both with customers and for the Volvo Group to come and to be better to develop the risk and reward and all the good opportunities that is coming with it.</p><p>Now we will continue actually with a tech expo. So let's get started, yes, to unveil a little bit what you will look at here.</p><p>So you can understand, this is the definition of beauty. And what we will do now is actually that all of you will go down here and we will gather here in the center. We will divide you into 4 groups. You have a chance to see both what we're doing in the performance piece of developing the service businesses by utilizing the connectivity and data, you will see electrification part of it, autonomous part of it, but also when it comes to the future development of the combustion engine developments and the well-known technologies and all the developments we have in that area.</p><p>Anything more to add, Christer?</p><p>CHRISTER JOHANSSON, SVP OF IR, AB VOLVO (PUBL): It sounds really good. And you have actually a letter on your nametag. So you are already divided into groups. So please just...</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Very smart. So follow the rules only.</p><p>CHRISTER JOHANSSON: Yes, exactly. Welcome down.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: So okay, welcome back. And hopefully, you have had also a good opportunity to interact with our experts and the senior expertise regarding both services and the new technologies and how that will apply into the business models.</p><p>I had a number of questions regarding how we will implement this now and scale it, and that is obviously one of the key areas that we are working a lot with now because this, as we discussed a little bit with Gustaf on Skanska and also when it comes to the Br\u00c3\u00b8nn\u00c3\u00b8y case, this is a product game, and we need to continue now to build and strengthen capabilities of organization focusing on doing the DDs for every type of application, every customer case and then having operations -- operational teams to implement it. And that will be, so to speak, a new business vertical that we are building.</p><p>Another important part of this, just to have in mind, is that this is not the unit count anymore. The difference when you take, for example, the Br\u00c3\u00b8nn\u00c3\u00b8y case when it comes to revenues per unit, is completely different than a normal type of application as we have today. And it is not in the magnitude of 2x, it's something more. And obviously, also when it comes to building long-term and midterm resilience, that is an important point.</p><p>One area -- one of the business areas that is leading this development, obviously, because they are representing -- they have the representation of the industrial verticals where this change is happening is Volvo Construction Equipment. We are also building together with this now the opportunity in the group to actually join forces and provide the full offering for our customers because with electrification and autonomous, our customers are looking through the full flow in their different parts, may it be waste management, may it be a construction site, a quarry, a port, a terminal or a mine.</p><p>So without further ado, the first time on the Capital Markets Day, the President of Volvo Construction Equipment outlining the here and now but also the future of Volvo Construction Equipment as a business area within the Volvo Group. And we start with a small movie explaining the story.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>MELKER JERNBERG, PRESIDENT, VOLVO CONSTRUCTION EQUIPMENT CORPORATION: It's fantastic, isn't it? I must start to say that Volvo, for me, is the culture, it's the spirit, it is how we work together. It's the relations; it's the relations in the company and it's the relations with our customers, dealers, suppliers and other partners. And it's about what we can do together today but also what we can do together in the future.</p><p>So my name is Melker Jernberg, and I'm the President of Volvo CE, and I'm happy to have the opportunity to talk to you about a big and important part of Volvo Group, the Construction Equipment business. Some of you probably participated a couple of years ago in the Capital Markets Day in Eskilstuna, and I will try to show you how the journey had developed since then and also how it will develop going forward.</p><p>One way, only one way of measuring a company and the performance of a company is through the financial numbers. We have had a very good development of the numbers, both when it comes to the net sales and the profitability the last years. We have been moving from like SEK 50-ish billion turnover to SEK 85 billion. And we have been moving from, let's say, 4% margin up to 13%, 14%. And actually, Q1 this year, we had above 15%. I think it's a good, strong, consistent improvement. And we have a lot of fundamentals in place when it comes to cost structure, way of working, footprint, organization, et cetera.</p><p>We also have more balanced, both earnings and profitability, if we look into how we define the world in our regions which, of course, is good when we have the strength in the markets. But also, actually, we have more balanced, both net sales and profitability, when it comes to the big, big product group. So I think this is good for the profitability, but also we will talk about the cycle going forward.</p><p>Before we look into the future, let's take a quick look back in the different periods that we have had in Volvo CE, starting with some kind of consolidation in the industry and a lot of acquisitions. And here, I would like to mention the very successful acquisition of the Samsung excavator business in '98. So actually this -- last autumn, we had a fantastic 20-years anniversary in Changwon in South Korea.</p><p>The next phase was growth in the emerging markets. And here is also when we started the joint venture in China, SDLG, been up and running now for 12 years. We'll come back to that later as well. Then we came in into the period a little bit tougher, tougher market, and we call it some kind of transformation internally in the company to improve the performance or the base for the performance. And now we are into the next step, and I will show and share some key areas in our future growth.</p><p>So with the base in the way we think and work in the Volvo Group, we have developed our 7 strategic priorities within Volvo CE. They are framed by the people and culture and the purpose, and the reason for that is simple. Because in an organization where everyone, I mean everyone, feel that they grow and develop every day, they feel that they are part of something bigger, they feel that they are seen, trusted and can contribute and also feel that they are responsible not only for the work they are doing, they are also responsible for the development of the work they are doing. In such an organization, the improvement is not 10%. It's not 20%. It is 100%. It's not based on some research. It's based on my own experience.</p><p>Then we also have an element of products, and we'll dig into excavators today. We have a market element, and we will look into China. We have the important deal in distribution with a focus on North America. We will look into that today as well. Profitability is, of course, performance but also performance over the cycle. And last but not least, the technology. And then, of course, it's the speed and the balance between the well-known technologies and the future technologies.</p><p>Let's start with the products. Some of you tried the excavators outside this morning. And the market development within the construction equipment, how we see it, how we measure it, the excavator part of that is actually now more than 50%. All other products are a little bit less than 50%. Excavators are 50% -- above 50%. So of course, it's very important. And we have had a good journey in the excavator segment. But obviously, the potential is -- and the untapped potential is big. We are working hard with awareness, the products, of course, the services and the parts.</p><p>If we take a look into the products, we have a very good strong basic lineup, and we also have had some good strong recent launches. We have a fantastic machine. It's called -- it's a 75-ton, high-reach machine, so it's extremely competitive and good demolition machine. And demolition is not a super-big segment when it comes to numbers, but it's a super-big segment when it comes to price of the machines and profitability. And you need to have good machines, and we have developed this for many, many years now.</p><p>We also have the hybrid. So we have a hydraulic hybrid. It's not easy to say. Hydraulic hybrid technology, which is not the same as you might have seen in the business or some other competitors are doing. So we are using the movement of the boom and charged hydraulic system. We are testing that in Germany for the moment.</p><p>And for those of you who tested excavators outside realize it's not so easy. So we launched -- also now launched at Malm\u00c3\u00b6 active control, which is a CME autonomous system. So you can actually -- either you have a file into the machine or you do it on the screen. So you program the machine for the shape and then you just control the speed. And if you tried, I mean you were happy if you digged one bucket out there, but imagine that you are doing the shape and you see the productivity in doing the shape, automatic instead of manual. So this is good for the productivity for unexperienced driver, but it's also very good for the productivity for experienced and good drivers.</p><p>Last but not least, we have the 20-ton EC200. This is a really big -- really good machine. I have extremely big hopes for this. It's a good machine in the biggest excavator segment. It's the most competitive segment, but it's also the biggest one. So real attractive offer. And of course, you realize that this machine is also extremely good fit and easy to sell for our network and our dealers.</p><p>A quick look at China. We have had a good journey the last decade in China, very fantastic joint venture. We have 2 strong brands. We have production plants. We have a technology center. We have a very good distribution network on both sides, and we have had a fantastic volume development.</p><p>So this is the base. And a couple of weeks ago, we also launched -- or we told that we will now take the next step because China is super important for us. We are extremely strong today together. We're extremely strong on the wheel loaders side on the SDLG brand, as you know. And now we have decided also to be even stronger going forward on the excavator side.</p><p>So the market change in China is that the wheel loader game is over. I mean we have a strong position and that is more or less set. And also, the machine types are going into more and more excavators also in China, of course, because of the way you can use an excavator. So what we're doing now is that we are bringing the strength together from both sides. So we take the strengths we have in the Chinese setup with the strengths we have within Volvo when it comes to technology and brand.</p><p>So we will do one product line, one brand above 15-ton as from end of next year when the China IV legislation come into play. And this is extremely important for us. Long term, we need to be there, and it's high competition for the moment. And of course, we are a global company, a global brand. But with this also, we want to feel, both inside and from outside, that we are a good domestic player as well. So hopefully, next time, I can come back and tell you about how successful we have been within that.</p><p>On the distribution side. As I said, the dealer network is extremely important. It's the primary customer interface. It's the interface for the customer experience. We have a good network. We have, on the Volvo side, 235 dealers around the world with 1,500 points, 95% privately owned.</p><p>And I would like to say a few words about the efforts we are doing in North America. It's important. We feel that we must improve. We are doing a lot of things with all our dealers when it comes to product training, sales training, repair and maintenance report, parts, sales training, sales management training. You name it. But we also have a lot of good and tough discussions with the dealers and putting high demand both on the performance and on the investments. And we have seen, in many cases, that it gives good results. But in some cases, it also ends with the termination of the contract and the change in the ownership and in the dealership.</p><p>And here, you can see some results of when a new owner come into a territory with a new spirit, new energy, new approach, new way of working. So I think we are moving in the important North America market. I think we have a short film now actually.</p><p>(presentation)</p><p>MELKER JERNBERG: So obviously, the dealers and our service capabilities is super important. One part of the profitability and the resilience is our services, and I must say that we have done our services more tangible. We have productified the services. And with the base of our connected machines and our Uptime Centers, we are also able to make specific solutions for specific customers, different customers, different demands, and with that also increased both the parts sales and the service contracts.</p><p>And in whole -- in this whole equation, I think there are some key elements. We have seen it earlier today as well. It's the service contracts, it's the parts penetration, it's the uptime, our work in uptime and it's the population.</p><p>And if we look at the development for Volvo CE, we can see on the service agreement that we have increased the numbers a lot, which is good, of course. But it's not only the numbers because it's also very important what kind of -- what kind or type of contract or agreement you have and also the length or the duration of the contracts. I think we are improving in all these 3 areas, so it's good.</p><p>When it comes to the part penetration, we have improved with 35% since 2015. When it comes to the uptime, we are monitoring more and more machines through our Uptime Centers. We have now Uptime Centers in North America, Latin America, Europe, of course, we have in India, China and also the APAC area.</p><p>And when it comes to population, it might have been a little bit flat because of the history, of course, but now we see a quite good increase here. And the 2019 is the estimate, of course, here. And with the last year's number of machine success sold, I see a pretty good development of the population going forward as well.</p><p>On the technology side, I think the Construction Equipment business can and will be a big part of the transformation here. I mean it's a kind of a new era. But on the other hand, we have been an innovative company for more than 108 (sic) [180] years, so we are quite confident that we will be super innovative also in this area. I mean we are talking about again the automation, the electromobility, the connected machines and the digital solutions. And of course then, the energy efficiency, the safety, the emissions and the consequence of that, of course, the higher profitability or performance for our customers.</p><p>And I mean, I'm so happy that Gustaf and Per-Erik presented the Electric Site. I mean it's super, super nice. We were there and it's -- you cannot -- I mean you can see the result, but also you can touch the feeling of people that actually were there and saw what we or you, we were doing together with Skanska. I mean just think about it, 3,500-liter diesel going down to 64. Of course, that is good. And what we showed with Electric Site is also that we used all these different technologies, plus the partnership or the cooperation. I think that's an extremely good example.</p><p>Now actually I would like to share another example with you that is on Jan's and Martin's dot slide, yellow or maybe the boss here would claim it's red, and that's about our compact equipment range. It's about our compact wheel loaders, and it's about our compact excavators. We have good machines, but we have low volumes, low market share, low profitability. It's an important, growing and big segment. So the question, of course, is what should we do? Should we exit? Should we try again with a new range of combustion machines? Or should we do something else, something more radical? Exit is not an option. Try again with the same solution, believe that we'll have a new result? I'm not sure.</p><p>So in January, we sent out a press release that we will now, on our smaller machines, go fully electric. And at the same time, we will also stop the diesel engine development of this range. I can promise you, it was not an easy decision to take. And it was -- I don't know if it was fun discussions, but it was a little bit different discussions I had with my colleagues and others. And you can imagine, \"Okay, this seems to be a very good idea, Melker. What's the market size?\" It's 0. So 100% of 0 will still be 0. So the volumes will be extremely unclear. Who are the customers? We don't know. And the cost for the machines is a little bit unclear. So of course, it was not a super-easy business case. But fortunately, we are confident that this is the right thing to do, it's the right timing and the change is coming and, of course, it will come in this segment.</p><p>It also opens up for new customers, both for us but also, of course, for our customers because now, obviously, you can go indoor, you can go agri, you can go food. You can even go into this indoor mushroom plants that I didn't even know existed before we started to look into this. And I guess there will be a lot more of these customer segments.</p><p>So in April, at Bauma, we launched the first 2 machines, the 2.5-ton wheel loader and the 2.5-ton excavator. And I can tell you that the interest was extremely high. And one interesting thing was when you talk to the customer, because the customers came immediately and say, \"I'll buy that one,\" 5 minutes after the launch. I said, \"Okay, so why do you buy it? Why do you want it?\" And then it's super clear, and that was all over the day, it was like \"because I believe in this and I want to be a part of the change.\" So it's also the, of course, the branding of our customers' companies. That was super, super great and good reception. So I should say that right now, we are taking the leadership in this space, and this space is still free, is still open.</p><p>We believe in a sustainable future. We believe in sustainable development for our employees. We believe in a sustainable development for our customers. We believe in a sustainable future for our shareholders, our owners. And we believe in a sustainable future for the planet. So we try to improve for all stakeholders in each and every decision we take. So I promise you -- Lars said it's fantastic to be an engineer. And I can promise you, it's fantastic to work with yellow machines. It's even more fantastic to work with yellow machines and be a part of shaping the future for our next generations. That's the reason why we always say we build a world we want to live in.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you, Melker. So by that, we are soon coming to the end of the presentations. Last week, I met actually with a business partner to us that quoted exactly the spot where the Volvo Group, where we are sitting right now. He said actually that the world has never moved quicker than today, but yet the world will never move as slow as it does now. And we hope that you actually have got that feeling when we are presenting this. And the reason is simple, that -- is that transportation, logistics, infrastructure will continue to grow. That is a fact, but it must be growing in a considerably more sustainable way. And the guys that are there with practical, pragmatic solutions, will win tomorrow. And we'll win because we need to shape this planet when it comes to CO2 execution, when it comes to noise, when it comes to safety, when it comes to particulate matters, NOx, et cetera. But we will also drive, so to speak, the opportunities that transportation is bringing when it comes to urbanization, when it comes to growing demands from populations, e-commerce, et cetera.</p><p>Perform is all about actually building the future, funding the future while still making Volvo a very attractive and interesting case for all stakeholders, for our customers, for our colleagues in the group and, of course, for all our investors that believes in Volvo as a good case for shaping the future. Driving that through excelling on the basics, we have been showing the last couple of years a good trajectory when it comes to continuous improvement, being close to the customers, at driving decentralization, decision-making, speed, agility; yet a lot of interesting headroom when it comes to the service business, when it comes to actually penetrate some of the industrial verticals even further with existing and ever-developing product and service offering that we have.</p><p>We are doing that also by continuously building business resilience with flexibility measures with different type of offerings when it comes to further deepening our service business. And we have shown a number of very concrete examples on that, not as the least through the connectivity piece, 1 million connected units, and we are just getting started. The interesting part of this world when you talk about digitalization and connectivity is that still, people are talking much about collection of data. The guys that are cracking the code on analytics and action will actually win. And hopefully, you have seen a number of interesting pieces of that.</p><p>The transformation part is obvious to all of you. I mean I think the use cases has been talking for themselves by accelerating that, both when it comes to the technology, but even more important, constructing the business model together with our partners, the partners upstream, horizontal and the most important with our customers. And in many cases, their customers will be decisive for the years to come now. And we are, of course, determined to manage both, and we are building a strong position also financially to do that and looking forward to continue to work with every one of you but also all investors around the globe.</p><p>So that is concluding the presentations today. We hope that you have found that valuable. And by that, we open up for Q&amp;A. And I will actually ask also our Deputy CEO, Jan Gurander, to come up on stage. And obviously, as I said, we have our strong lineup of dear colleagues here. It's all about people. So feel free to ask and utilize the moment to ask whatever questions you like to ask. Thank you.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Yes, please.</p><p>DANIELA C. R. DE CARVALHO E COSTA, MD &amp; HEAD OF THE EUROPEAN CAPITAL GOODS EQUITY RESEARCH TEAM, GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP INC., RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Daniela Costa from Goldman Sachs. I actually have 3 questions, if possible. First question, regarding what you talked about the margin resilience and that there was further still to go there. How shall we think about what is the limit on where we can optimize this business? What would be peak to trough given the cyclicality intrinsically in this business? That's my first question.</p><p>And then a subsegment to that question. I want to break out -- we talked a lot about the flexibility on the cost structure around the Truck side, and I was curious on the Construction Equipment side if the type of flexibility or the possibilities to flexibilize the cost structure are similar.</p><p>And then one final question regarding the capital allocation. Jan mentioned, when he was talking through, \"when we have the possibility for extraordinary remuneration through shareholders, we'll do it.\" And I was wondering how you classify what's the conditions to have the possibility.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Thank you very much. Where shall we start? Shall we start with maybe then the first question with the margins? Obviously, I think Jan Ytterberg was very clear on that. What we say is, obviously, given where we are in the cycle, we are still -- we still have work to be done in all business areas actually to build up the resilience. And there are 2 pieces of it. First and foremost, I mean the underlying continuous improvement of the quality of the business, the earnings. And the second piece is obviously to reduce, so to speak, the high volatility also in earnings that we have had, depending on the different parts of the cycle or where we have been into.</p><p>And I think also one example out of that, that was shown today was, for example, the North American piece where we had the pretty big trough in 2016, 2017, where we could clearly see, we didn't reveal the exact number, but it was a considerable improvement when it comes to the operating margin of that business. So I think you should think about it both in terms of, I mean, what is the midpoint over the cycle, obviously should be over 10%. But also thinking about that, I mean the spread is also something through flexibility and service business that we are working on.</p><p>I don't know, Melker, maybe if you would like to mention a little bit on the flexibility in the Construction Equipment business.</p><p>MELKER JERNBERG: I think, first of all, I think we have a much better position to start from when it comes to the profitability level. We have a much better cost structure, and you have seen that also in the leverage that we have had with the volumes. And that, combined with what I showed on the parts penetration, the potential is still there and also on the service contracts and the population, I think that will be good guidance of the resilience or the flexibility that we have. And of course, also we have a lot of measures to do when and if it goes down.</p><p>JAN GURANDER, DEPUTY CEO &amp; MEMBER OF THE GROUP EXECUTIVE BOARD, AB VOLVO (PUBL): I think it's fair to say also that the same kind of examples that Jan mentioned before, and I think we work with the same kind of principles and methods in the whole group. It's not only about Trucks or VCE, it goes also for Volvo Buses and Penta. It's the same kind of preparations that we do when it comes to that to bring down the volatility, so it's absolutely not only for Trucks.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: And on the last piece, and I think we can complement each other there, but I mean I think we've shown one example this spring, actually, when we see that there is, so to speak, room for an extra dividend, so to speak, we will act on that. I mean we always say that when we want to be a little bit between clear and a little bit, so to speak, unclear, we'll say -- I mean we'll say we don't want to become a bank because we think you guys are better off doing your part of business.</p><p>But having said that, given cyclicality, given opportunity to maneuver from a position of strength in different parts of the cycle, not at least in a down cycle, there the very interesting opportunities will arise. We will not have big need of a further consolidation when it comes to volume. We have the scale necessary, but there will always be interesting birds flying by. And we think it's always interesting to be able to maneuver from a position of strength.</p><p>To what Jan said -- Ytterberg said about that it's extremely important for our financial business, Financial Services business to have a strong and solid rating. The Financial Services business will be increasingly more important when we are building the solutions for the transformation and the trust building. And we will utilize that transaction system also and that business relations, use them even more and then to have, so to speak, a very strong foundation.</p><p>So I think we have been clear. I mean, obviously, when we are in the cycle where we are now when we should have a net cash 0 position, it should not be good for anyone here in the room, right? But having said that, I think the underlying strength that we are building will give opportunities as we were clear about saying both building and transforming this industry, but also giving good shareholder return. And if I were doing my mathematics right, I think we have been a good piece to pick when it comes to total shareholder return the last 4, 5 years.</p><p>KLAS HENRIK BERGELIND, DIRECTOR, CITIGROUP INC, RESEARCH DIVISION: Can you hear me?</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Is this Klas from Citigroup?</p><p>KLAS HENRIK BERGELIND: It is Klas from Citi. So 3 questions from me as well. I'll take them one at a time, if I could. So first, a question on CapEx in R&amp;D. I think Jan, sitting down, he alluded to some potential creep going forward. Obviously, there is a lot of new technologies out there, but could you give us some steer on where we can go to? Obviously, we're coming from a situation where we had CapEx depreciation back in the days that were at 30% above. And obviously, we're not going back to that level. But could we get some steer on where we can go to in terms of CapEx in R&amp;D and especially in the light of heavy duty if you see more fleets going green?</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Who would like to...</p><p>JAN GURANDER: No, I can. No, I think we started to talk about this already 1.5, 2 years ago that we -- I mean, we will start to see a little bit of a creep upwards and especially when it comes to the R&amp;D. And I think you're perfectly correct, when I look upon all the things that we want to do, we need to do for our customers going forward, we cannot skip the, obviously, the combustion engine and we have a lot of things. You will continue to see a step upwards in R&amp;D.</p><p>It will be a gradual shift that we are doing. I think as a consequence of that also, because when you invest in products and solutions going forward, you will actually have a little bit of a drag also on CapEx, as more of a function of that than that we have outdated factories or anything like that. So you will see that coming as well. We will not give any indication where it will end up or anything like that, but a little bit of a continued creep upwards, that's what you will see.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: And I think, having said, that's a very good investment also because with the lineup we have now in the structure of, so to speak, the company, I feel also that we have a good conversation going on, so to speak, between the business areas and the new created, also, business areas and then our industrial technology backbone on where do we put our bets, how do we do it. You will see partnerships coming up, et cetera. But if anything, you can say, with a SEK 400-plus billion top line now, if anything, I should say that we all have been, so to speak, from an average perspective, maybe on R&amp;D, a little bit on the low side. I mean you should think about that in order to cope with these opportunities also. I mean, to be south of 5% on R&amp;D investment is -- might be a little bit on the low side in order to capture the opportunities.</p><p>But then I think even more important is, I mean, this type of examples that we have shown now, and that is for all of us to think about, what will be in the future R&amp;D, what will be in the future SG&amp;A, what will be production costs, et cetera. And that's the reason why I told you also that. I mean, when we are putting these solutions into place, it will not be the same type of balance sheet and P&amp;L that you have seen historically because the revenue streams will come differently and not at least over time and how you look upon it.</p><p>But again, perform to fund this, we are not backing off from, so to speak, what we have promised when it comes to financial targets, but we will invest them correctly. And if anything, maybe more so in this type of initiatives, when I say bird flying by, maybe on the add-on technology pieces and partnerships.</p><p>KLAS HENRIK BERGELIND: And that was my second question, birds flying by. So thinking about M&amp;A, obviously, there has been no M&amp;A for good reasons for a long time. You're talking about some verticals still being interesting from a new technology perspective, and obviously, mining is at the center of that, and you bought parts of Terex a few years back. Would mining be an interesting area to add on more to the portfolio? If you could comment a little bit on M&amp;A.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: First and foremost, I think what is -- what we have done that I feel is the starting point of any type of conversation around M&amp;A and I think to your point also, for good reasons, is that really to understand and deep dive what are -- what is our current potential organically; what are possible, so to speak, add-ons, both when it comes to geographical coverage; what part of the value chain could be interesting, both when it comes to, I mean, add-on technology wise, it could be, so to speak, add-on from a product line-wise or be inclusive to the customer.</p><p>But my reading on mining when I talked to a lot of the customers is that, first and foremost, we have an untapped potential by combining. But I mean M&amp;A-ing ourselves when it comes to the key account structure of mining because we have not utilized the full force of going to the customers in that vertical because that is a little bit a backdrop of our way of being organized with the business areas. It has had a lot of advantages, but now we are also creating subsets of that. So we are creating strong key account structures in order to utilize what we already have. But my personal belief is that this is an area that could be interesting for certain bolt-ons, yes.</p><p>OLOF CEDERHOLM, ANALYST, ABG SUNDAL COLLIER HOLDING ASA, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Olof, with ABG. First, a couple of questions on the services business. We talked a lot about that today. But if I say that it's been around 20%, 25% of sales historically, depending on over the cycle, so to speak, where do you think that can go going forward given if you do this well? So that's the first one. The second one, could you elaborate on the margins in this business? It's always exciting and would be fantastic to get a little something on that. And then lastly, on the cycle management. It's widely expected that the U.S. market will come down next year. Could you tell us a little bit about your tangible plans on how to manage this potential downturn? That would be very interesting, too.</p><p>JAN GURANDER: I think on the service side, I think there is always this kind of -- everybody wants to kind of increase the sales of services as a total -- as a percent of total sales. And then you get into should you have targets or not, and then you come into debate where are you in the cycle, are you low in the cycle? It will be higher. Or where we are right now, it will be a little bit lower. I think what Jan showed before, actually, and I think maybe you, also, Martin, is more to focus on the absolute level of sales that we are doing. I mean, the increase that we see, instead of kind of setting a target for this percentage. And I mean, we have now for, I think, quite some quarters in a row, managed to grow the service sales with actually somewhere between 5% and 10%. And the type of business that we are in, that's quite a good growth, actually.</p><p>So rather focus on that, think about also what Jan mentioned before when it comes to the absorption rather to say where will it be in terms of percentages. I think you will always come back and say, yes, you said 30%, and now we -- you are at 35%. Yes, we are down with the unit sales. And then we, vice versa, we will have a constant debate about that. So rather focus on the absolute sales level and how that is growing. That's what -- that was also the reason why we started to disclose that every quarter as well. It was a little bit also to say that, that is important. It's the absolute number that's important and how that is growing.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Maybe just to -- I couldn't agree more. I mean, maybe just to add on it. It's also that what we see now, the importance of creating, so to speak, if you take from a pure financial standpoint, a better understanding of the full potential of the different applications when it comes to treating, so to speak, a truck or a construction machinery as its own P&amp;L and see where is the full potential.</p><p>I mean, the one-to-one relation with the services that we have for that application and see what is our success rate, what is our potential, both when it comes to the first owner. And what we see also as a big potential is the second or third owner, because one of the good parts, for example, with the mix improvement that we have seen in construction segment, for example, for trucks is that the average age of the first owner is between 6 and 7 years; while longhaulers have it on 3 to 4 years, specifically in the more developed markets. And with the pretty big drop that we have there to really be granular enough to follow and hunt this, I normally say that if I have the chance to carve out certain verticals in our Parts business, I would be -- and do a small IPO, I would be doing that any day of the week.</p><p>So we need to have organizations treating this as the business that they do every day, see the full potential and working, so to speak, with the yield when it comes to the penetration rate and when it comes to the pricing points and bundle it into service and repair contracts, driving that through, I mean, a full captive offering that we get through these contracts of the first owner and then also giving the same type of offerings for second and third owner. So to Jan's point, it is about really driving more through the full potential of it and to set, I mean -- because the last 3, 4 years, we have been decreasing service share of the top line, but that is thanks to the fact that equipment has been growing even quicker. But we know also in a downturn, it will decrease much lower. When it comes to margins, we will reiterate the very granular also by saying it's higher than equipment, actually.</p><p>And the last one, yes, it was...</p><p>JAN GURANDER: North America.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Yes. North America, yes. First and foremost, I mean, when we look through North America activity levels through our connected units, we have a very, very detailed and good conversations with our dealer groups. One example of that, we have the Volvo Trucks dealer counsel over from North America last week. We were sitting a long day talking about the different dynamics, et cetera.</p><p>Yes, it will cause some sort of correction, let's see when that is happening. I think a lot of people are factoring in now because order books has been shrinking, the order intake has been lower. But still, this is a necessary correction of doing, so we get the right balance. I mean, when you don't have visibility because the order board is 8 to 9 months, it's not good for anyone.</p><p>We have been, as we have communicated, restrictive on putting in retail orders for '20. We are putting in that, obviously, for the customers that need to have that visibility. But when it comes to retail order board, it doesn't serve anyone.</p><p>The good news is that we have a good flexibility in the structure, that was what we discussed and Jan showed in North America. We were down 40%, and we still have solid black. Ever since, we have continued to improve that, so we are well prepared. But more important now is to have the right balance. We have a better balance between supply and the demand. And I think that was healthy after a couple of -- or quite a number of quarters, we were at stretched situations.</p><p>HAMPUS ENGELLAU, AUTOMOTIVE ANALYST, HANDELSBANKEN CAPITAL MARKETS AB, RESEARCH DIVISION: Hampus Engellau, Handelsbanken. Two questions from me. Coming back to the group, a lot of the strategy historically has been to create synergies on the drivetrain and between all the business areas. And it seems like we're moving into more complex engine setup. We might have distribution tracks on battery and hybrids, on long haul and maybe construction battery. How do you see that affecting your aftermarket business and also synergies going forward that you already have today that you might lose out on and eventually, I guess, the profitability? That's my first question.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: I don't know, Lars, if you would like to start to comment on that when it comes to the modularity piece, et cetera.</p><p>LARS STENQVIST: Thank you for the question. And I think I touched upon it in the presentation already. We see a lot of possibilities. I think that we need to understand that the group went through a tough period of acquisitions and then getting the programs together, coming from very many different platforms.</p><p>In the area of new technologies, we have the possibility of doing a drive from the very beginning, starting sort of on white piece of paper. And by that, we can, as [David] and team showed down here, we can design electrical motors, batteries, et cetera, in order to get the maximum synergies output for the new technologies. That's how we are thinking.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: And, I mean, then you'll just say where will you have less scale down, I mean, on the combustion thing. I think the good news is that it will not happen to us in that case. Let's say it's always a discussion about the relative competitiveness you have. When you're doing acquisitions, et cetera, it is easy to have a good story about all the synergies. And when the company leaders and the investment bankers have left the room, you know there are some empty glasses of champagne there and there is 10, 15 years of hard work to get their act together.</p><p>And I'm very happy to see that we have got this act together now, primarily on the heavy-duty side when it comes to powertrain. There is still headroom for improvement when it comes to medium-duty where we are now addressing that, actually, on the 5 and 8, primarily on the 8 to start with. And that will still give, because now we have multiples of scale when it comes to, so to speak, the number counts that you need to have. So I mean, we have room for a decrease and still have a superior scale to a lot of other players.</p><p>I think even that can create also interesting opportunities actually for being -- that can be beneficial as also provider of that type of equipment going forward. But while at the same time, then building up. And then we can do it from the start, as Lars said. We have been rather disciplined, actually, in the base platform, the modularity and the performance steps when it comes to electromobility and autonomous pieces. And that's the reason why we gave then that through what we call the GTX, and that is purchasing a technology and operations together. So we are building a very strong modular platform where, so to speak, our business areas can pull from. But that requires discipline to do that, but it should still be then agile to apply, and I think we showed that with all the launches that we have done.</p><p>HAMPUS ENGELLAU: Can I do my last question then? I think last year was a very much a year of production disturbances from the sub-suppliers. What we hear now, it seems like that situation got better. Could you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of productivity potential for the group this year, given that it seems like the market are more stabilizing, around 300,000, in Europe and U.S.?</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: I don't know. Jan, would you like to start to comment that, on the leverage and things like that?</p><p>JAN YTTERBERG: Well, is it on? Yes. Okay. Well, I talked about it in relation to what we call excel on the basics. We have, of course, have a lot of extra cost to be able to ramp up the system to the level we have had. And when we get some kind of stability, we can take out some of the extra emergency freights and shifts, et cetera, which is, of course, when we are now having a situation where we are going down slightly here in Europe and European production is less of a problem.</p><p>Okay, we are losing on the absorption side, but we are gaining on the extra costs side, so to say. But of course, there is a limit to this as well when it starts to more of halt. But as I said, it's good that we have the time in the -- with the order book we have to be able to adjust the cost base in an ordered way. And when I say cost base, it's not only -- it's actually more on our SG&amp;A and on the R&amp;D side that we are able to adjust our ambitions and priorities to a new lower situation. So don't think only about production when we talk about things we can do to improve the leverage in case of downturns.</p><p>JAN GURANDER: Well, I think, it's fair -- I mean, it's fair to say we have had 2 years of a lot of hard work. I mean [in the area] with the suppliers have not been an easy period. And Jan also, of course, Jan also in production. And I can tell you that a lot of focus is actually to serve our customers, to get the machines out to the customer in time, hopefully with a good delivery reliability. But the machine is absolutely not optimal when you're reaching these kind of high levels of production. So in a way, that we never know what -- with a little bit of more normal pacing in our machine get for the suppliers, to getting good order and good shape and also for ourselves actually. We talk about some of our factories that have been running 24/7, actually about 100% technical installed capacity, some other factors (inaudible) exactly. So we need a little (inaudible).</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: We call it the operation of the bumblebee. I mean they don't know how to fly, but they are flying.</p><p>JAN GURANDER: Yes. So we need to breathe a little bit then. So from that point of view, I'm not -- if you have a little bit of a slower -- for the time, we're adjusting Europe right now a little bit, it doesn't necessarily mean that you will see a big effect on any kind of margins going forward.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: And, I mean, the leverage factor that we did see in quarter 1 was encouraging also. I mean, of course, for all of you, guys, but then for our stakeholders. But I have to say, because we had a very positive leverage there and very important for our own people, because they've been fighting extremely hard and dedicated around the clock and also our suppliers. And to see that's coming true, finally, because the underlying, so to speak, productivity has been the [error have] improved, et cetera, but it has been a little bit coming out through then these, these [store] business called stop-and-go situations. So when we talked about it, for example, in North America after the Mack changeover, with [Ilke Loomba] and his team.</p><p>I mean when we can run, we have a fantastic situation, but we cannot run that frequently as we like. And when you need to catch up every week, they're pretty harsh and then almost stop again maybe Tuesday morning again, that is, from the motivational part, very tough. But I have to say that what we saw in quarter 1, our -- has been very good for the organization as well and eventually also coming through in figures.</p><p>JAN YTTERBERG: One thing which I might add which was I was a little joking with my fellows in Executive Board around the scenario planning for a downturn. Interesting to see is, of course, that when you do this kind of exercises, you suddenly start to ask yourself, \"Well, why don't we do this already now? Why do we have to wait for a downturn until we do it?\" So we will get some productivity and efficiency also from actually doing these exercises, so it's a good trade-off.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Yes.</p><p>GUILLERMO PEIGNEUX-LOJO, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND INDUSTRIALS ANALYST, UBS INVESTMENT BANK, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Guillermo Peigneux from UBS. Just a couple of questions. The first one is a little bit mid-term, so apologies for that in advance. But, obviously, in the past, the industry and yourselves were subject to emission standard changes, well-defined changes with deadlines that were very clear, technology risks, obviously, with well-defined deadlines in the end, which basically created pre-buy and post-buy effects. Now we're talking about a step change transformation technology, which is all very optimistic, and I would embrace that optimism. But at the same time, there's a technology risk. And it's a little bit less well defined in the sense that we don't know when batteries are going to be efficient. We don't know when autonomous is going to be fully autonomous and on what kind of legislations, so to say. Is that sort of, in the midterm, can create customer hesitance when it comes to basically notwithstanding that we are at that part of a cycle and also notwithstanding that we have 5 to 10 years useful life for trucks. Could we see some kind of delay and hesitation when it comes to spending in new trucks, heavy-duty especially?</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: No. I think this is a very interesting question that, obviously, we have been discussing also what will be the effects of demand when things are starting to move in some of the new technology areas. I think, probably, we will see that from time to time. I think the good news, though, is that if you look at the construct and how we are, so to speak -- where we are today as a group, we -- and that's the reason why we showed that also -- one of the reasons why we showed that. We have a good geographic spread that will emerge in different pieces and we have also good segment mix, probably more so than maybe you thought about when it comes to the different industrial verticals. And I think that is, maybe, the best protection to it because both the geographical mix and the segment and application mix because we'll actually do that this will come into different steps because you will not see the same timing for a long haulage as you will see in quarry or in a city when it comes to these different technologies and business models.</p><p>But at the same time, one of the key enablers for us is actually to be able to scale this more project-selling solutions in a good way while -- when demand is coming. And we had a leadership summit a couple of weeks ago. We discussed that just to mentally start to prepare ourselves.</p><p>I mean Gustaf is saying, okay, there are 1,000 quarries only in Sweden. Probably, some of those quarries are of the size where you can just back in one of these units and you can just take gravel into one piece and then you tip it on the other side, but there are enough numbers. And when you start to think mentally, how do you scale this and the abilities, that is a key thing that we are working a lot with, actually. But I think we are -- from the transformation -- I think, actually, the initial levels actually have created bigger hiccups because they have come coordinated, they have come in the biggest areas, they have been visible for long time and created a lot of volatility in demand, actually.</p><p>JAN GURANDER: I think it might even be good, actually, because here, hopefully, when you don't -- I mean, with this kind of volatility with prebuys and everything, here it will be very much driven from our customers, actually. It will be their total cost of ownership, reduction of CO2. So it will be more kind of business-driven rather than it's driven from regulation. So I think that will only be good for this development. Then as we have shown, different segments will be earlier to adopt than others, like in electromobility and medium-duty trucks or light-duty trucks and so on before it goes into heavy-duty, so I think it's already a positive, actually.</p><p>GUILLERMO PEIGNEUX-LOJO: If I can, one more, more on technology I guess. When I think about your service business, especially when it comes to parts, I guess, heavy-duty versus the RVV that you showed us today. The only thing I can say is lower moving parts -- lower number of moving parts. So, I guess, the mistake could be to associate lower moving parts to raw revenue from services. But, I guess, I want to understand what would be the dynamic when it comes to aftermarket in an RVV versus a heavy-duty truck, for example.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: I mean, if you take everything like-for-like, and we are obviously looking into this very much and I think a good piece of that is the experience we have also from the bus business. And I mean, we have been out there now for quite some years. RVV customers like QLS that we heard today, for example, they are extremely professional in measuring because they are in a very tense situation when it comes to their long contracts. They have often longer contracts when it comes to, so to speak, the -- how long they operate the fleet, often with a 10-year visibility. So we have a lot of good data about this.</p><p>And like-for-like, it is what you say. It is actually less complex machine as a totality. But at the same time, you're adding other type of pieces. You're engaging more in depth in the system solutions and working on that. And that's the -- one also of the reason why I mentioned that with the cases that we see now, it is a different way you're looking at the P&amp;L per unit when it comes to where do you engage, how do you engage.</p><p>And if you just take the traditional portion, workshop hour lower. But one still have to remember that the combustion piece is one part of a rather complex machine, so to speak. So it's not about also braking, steering, transmissions and things like that, that would be needed. But the business definition is looking different, as we saw. And that's the reason why the service journey also from that angle is so important.</p><p>MATS LISS, FORMER EQUITY RESEARCH ANALYST, KEPLER CHEUVREUX, RESEARCH DIVISION: Mats Liss, Kepler Cheuvreux. Just a question there. I mean you had talked about -- a lot about these megatrends this afternoon. And I guess, my question is more related to synergies in relation to a smaller car producer. And is there any sort of direct, any synergies there that you -- or order synergies in sort of integrating a car and truck producer? Do you think there are opportunities in sort of such a cooperation?</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: I mean, let's put it like this. There are areas with a car producer or there are areas with construction. I mean, I remember at one point in time, I showed 3 pieces of equipment, I mean, a stone crusher, truck and a car, and said -- I mean, like, (inaudible) was saying, one shall be moved away here. Who is it? And that was, in that case, the car from a business model perspective because, I mean, we are pure B2B in that perspective.</p><p>Then when you look through the technology pieces, obviously there are a number of things. I mean, if you take the cooperation that we're seeing now today, I mean the width and breadth with the NVIDIA, obviously they have, to my knowledge, maybe announced to one car producers, parts of that will be utilizing that the acquisition, so to speak. But a lot of things are also vastly different when it comes to, I mean, only physical things like where do you need to have, for example, when it comes to autonomous development, your perception systems, how does that work together with the vehicle dynamics or width, et cetera. So yes, there are synergies. I don't think they are decisive to keep things together. I think there are other ways of doing it. And the reason why we feel that the way that we are constituted now is working is that there are more similarities when it comes to the businesses that we are operating into now that are purely B2B-driven, and thereby, also, when it comes to durability requirements, life-related requirements, wear and tear requirements, safety requirements are more similar, so to speak.</p><p>But as I said already a little bit in the presentation, scale and -- is something that you should work a lot with to define where do you have the necessity of scale, how do you go after that and how do you still keep the flexibility and the operation freedom, so to speak, in a smart way. I don't know if you would like to...</p><p>JAN GURANDER: No. Actually, I think the decisive difference is, basically, business-to-business compared to business-to-consumer and how we can grow our activities in this different areas, different business more. And I think we have more -- much more similarities, commonalities in the group than what we will have with the car companies saying now we need to come with a new car model, that time of the year, full electric. A little bit difficult to say how that is, but on some basis, there are definitely...</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: What we hope for is, obviously, that we continue to drive more on an industry platform basis both. I mean everything that is mobility, for example, the buildout of the sourcing and infrastructure, the IPS systems, so we can apply this in broader scale, et cetera, because it's one part of what we do with our partners, but it's also a societal piece, obviously. And there, I think, the 2 industries, if I put it like that, can support each other, and that is important.</p><p>HARALD CHRISTIAAN HENDRIKSE, MD, MORGAN STANLEY, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Harald Hendrikse from Morgan Stanley. Just to go back to the emission standards which, with the car industry, is really having a big problem with now for 2021. When we were talking to the car companies back in '15, '16, '17, it was like we'll invest more money, but we can meet the standards. And suddenly, 3 years later, we've got there and now they're having to spend a huge amount of money, specifically on content, really, for the next 18 months to get to these targets. How do you feel -- how aggressive are these '25 and '30 targets that the European Union is setting for the truck manufacturers? How -- have you already got around to a road map to getting yourselves down there? Is it really electric mix or is it actual further content? And how does that change the cost of the combustion engine?</p><p>And then with that, big concern, again, in the automotive side is the profitability of the electric products, right, how does that compare? And is your customer actually willing to pay up for the improved productivity or their better TCO? And I think you probably have an advantage in the B2B that you may be able to price it better. But can you talk about that a little bit more please?</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Yes. If we start with, I mean, the first question regarding the 2025 legislations, and then you have a similar road map also in United States and Japan, et cetera. The answer on that is, yes, it will be a mix of different solutions, and that's the reason why we are pronouncing so much the modularity of it. When we look through, so to speak, our road maps, it is a large part into it, you have to leave them for the press conference here with Nvidia.</p><p>But it is a mix between, so to speak, working continuously with the well-known technologies. It is not a walk in the park, if I put it like that. We have constructed a roadmap where we have, so to speak, a number of different opportunities, and that is incorporated, so to speak, in our R&amp;D road map.</p><p>Then it is also an opportunity, and a positive opportunity, I think, also, to drive the customer mix and have a good conversation of more of a TCO base case because what we actually mentioned also from QLS was really that, I mean, if you take, for example, the public procurement process, primarily in Europe, it has been too much based on the upfront price roll than, so to speak, what is the life cycle impact of investments.</p><p>And our view is that, that conversation must be pursued for the urban applications to be completely different extent: waste collection, distribution. And we see that already happening through all, so that cities will pay so much penalties themselves for air quality, so they need really to do something.</p><p>So I think the good -- really tough demands, but the good news is that it is in line with the journey that we have to do anyhow, so to speak. So I think that is the difference also to the -- it's a much more obvious opportunity to have that conversation with the customers, if I put it like that, than if you're a private user of a car.</p><p>GRAHAM PHILLIPS, SVP INDUSTRIALS, CAPITAL GOODS RESEARCH, JEFFERIES LLC, RESEARCH DIVISION: It's Graham Phillips from Jefferies. I mean 2 questions. If we just extend a little bit further on those 2 target. Can you tell us what your CO2 average fleet figure is today, so we can think about this 25% and the 30% reduction? And when you talk about R&amp;D costs going up, I guess, you're talking in what, euro terms, absolute terms, percentage of sales, because, clearly there will be -- that will be a fixed cost, that if there is a downturn, you're not going to be able to change that at all?</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: I mean, on the R&amp;D -- let's start with your last comment, Graham. And I mean, first and foremost, I think, yes, a big part of R&amp;D you should consider, so to speak, as fixed because we need to invest both for our competitive position, but also to really cope with the upcoming challenges or legislations that we have.</p><p>But having said that, there is still also a part where we can actually can adjust it when it comes to certain application and segments if we are really coming into a severe, so to speak, point in the cycle. So R&amp;D from that perspective is still also possible to operate, and we are keeping also flexibility in terms of the mix between what we have as permanent stuff and also flexible, so to speak, engineering resources. But still, I agree on that, that is an important piece.</p><p>Then again, what we are -- it will continue to increase. We think that it is important not at least from a competitive position to do so. We think that, gradually, when we look through our cost mix that investing in R&amp;D is a good investment, it's important to do so.</p><p>I still think that we can manage that in a good way, given the fact that we have been spending quite considerable amount of money during the last 10, 15 years of more the integration piece between the different brands, business areas, that has also taking a pretty big share of our R&amp;D spending, so to speak. So you should still think about it as manageable in a very positive way, if I put it like that. So that is not something that is keeping us awake at night when it comes to reaching and exceeding our financial targets, if I take one example.</p><p>GRAHAM PHILLIPS: So do we have an idea of what your average CO2 fleet figure is today that has to fall by 15 and...</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Yes, we have that idea, yes.</p><p>GRAHAM PHILLIPS: Forget that, hopefully later.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: No. No. But I think, yes, I think Lars said it pretty clear. Again, it is a tough endeavor. I mean Europe and also North America, Japan and other markets that are going for this type of legislations. But I mean, when we look through our roadmap, the position, we are standing on the different options we have, we have a clear view on that.</p><p>GRAHAM PHILLIPS: Perhaps I could ask another question. So when you look at the business model going forward, some of the more successful companies are asset-light. So clearly, the business model is changing, you're talking about more services, perhaps less spare parts coming with electric vehicles. But does the fixed investment with an electric vehicle become a lot less than -- can you buy in more components that happen to make a big chunk of metal with a big industrial -- ICE engine? Does that change, or do you still want to have a lot of that in-house technology?</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Would you like to start?</p><p>JAN GURANDER: I think it's a little bit too early exactly to say what it is. I think, obviously, I think, in the beginning, I mean the depth of engagements, the width of engagement is something that I think we gradually have to grow into. I mean it's not obvious if you take one example that -- I mean, take battery cells as one example. Today, no plans to do that, and I would guess that 5, 10 years from now, probably not want to do that. When it comes to the packing of the batteries into the truck, then there might be reasons for that we should invest into that because we need to have it closer to the production line. There are logistic reasons, there are also -- when it comes to how many packs we should put into the modular system and so on. So I think that will probably move a little bit going forward. And I don't think we should give any exact answers to that. But in the beginning, you will probably buy more things than you will actually develop yourselves.</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: And I think one good opportunity that we have is that we are well spread geographically when it comes to our value chains. And what we feel is that we can continue to develop from, so to speak, the positions where we are sitting today. And depending then on the decision or the depth of engagement we will have for certain components or technologies, will, for me, mainly be driven by the ability to actually take down, so to speak, the need of longer pipelines logistically and to be able to tailor-made because, as you've heard earlier today, funny enough, for example, electromobility will be even more tailor-made to every application in order to have the right balance between packs or energy storages, et cetera.</p><p>So from that reason, I think we have a good industrial footprint to utilize, do it smartly, maybe take some decisions to take out some things so we can be a little bit more asset-light. But I don't foresee that we need to expand in new footprints, but maybe convert some of our current abilities in a smart way, while continuing, as you said, to work in the acquisition.</p><p>JAN GURANDER: And it's of course dependent also where we see that -- where there is a competence or knowledge that we should have that brings value. I mean it's not the assets, per se, it's also what kind of returns these assets can give us as well. So, I mean, being asset-light just for being asset-light, there might be some competencies and so on that we have that...</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: (inaudible)</p><p>JAN GURANDER: And give a good return, actually, so -- yes? Do you have a question, Christopher?</p><p>MARTIN LUNDSTEDT: Oh, you're done now.</p><p>JAN GURANDER: Okay. There will be time also for conversations, obviously, during the dinner also. So we conclude by then and hope that you have had a interesting day and a little bit better informed about the future also in our industry.</p><p>So thank you very much for coming.

And then Caroline Kn\u00c3\u00b6ri, our Head of HR, will give you an update on how we create a great workplace for some of the best talents in the industry. After that, it's Q&amp;A with all of us, and then we will try to fit in a small break that we can all recover from those live streams we're all pretty used to right now.</p><p>Then part 2, it's Asset Management with Axel Schwarzer, our Head of Asset Management and Head of Investments; and with Marko R\u00c3\u00b6der, our Global Head of Sales within Asset Management with another dedicated Q&amp;A sessions. Then another quick break, and then we will be back with part 3 with Georg Schubiger, our Head of Wealth Management; Markus Pfister with an update on our capital market activities within Structured Solutions &amp; Treasury. And then Thomas Heinzl, our Chief Financial Officer, will do the financials and the roundup, and we will all be back for third Q&amp;A session. So that's the overview. Let's kick off.</p><p>So whenever we want to move ahead into the future and shape and conquer the future, it's helpful to quickly look back and take stock of where we are, what brought us to the point where we are and what we can take as learnings from where we are before we move forward. So I'm happy to report that over the last years, we were able to deliver the growth. We were able to outpace global growth in wealth by a factor of 2. And it is from this position of strength that we decided to took the next step on our journey to become a pure play buy-side only global investment firm.</p><p>We strongly believe that our journey into the future will be driven by 4 strategic levers: client centricity and investment led at the core. We see client centricity and being investment led as 2 sides of the same coin that drive us in bringing investment solutions that fit the needs of our clients. We are technology-enabled and will strive to become ever more so. And we are very aware of the fact that in our industry, ever more so in the future with more technology, people will make the difference, and we strive for the best talents in our industry.</p><p>Let me quickly report to you how we have done against the business plan and the targets we have announced on our last Investor Day 3 years ago, before we then use the time to think ahead and try to explain and onboard you on how we want to move forward and how we want to achieve our targets now in the next phase. So how have we done in the last phase since our last Investor Day? We pretty much delivered on growth. So on average, our top line grew by 6.4% on an annualized basis, which is above the target range that we put ourselves up to. We also reached the upper boundary in terms of net new money with 5.9% against the range of 4% to 6%.</p><p>So I think that's what's very important to us, that is very important to us, that will remain very important to us, to deliver on organic growth. Also in terms of profitability, we made progress. We deliver a return on equity of 13.4% in H1 and have been always close to our target of 14%. We missed our target on cost/income ratio that we have actually increased after the acquisition of Notenstein La Roche. We're now at 74.7%. Our CFO will give you a more detailed update on what the details and what facts are behind the progress we made, but also why we decided to keep investing into future organic growth.</p><p>In terms of capital, we made the targets. We are now at 20.2%. So after we completed the last acquisition, we were at 18.9%. So we were able to accumulate capital and to build and continue to have a very strong balance sheet, while at the same time being true to our dividend promise and paying over the 3 year CHF 6.5 per share out to shareholders.</p><p>We have also pretty strongly and decisively changed the characteristics of the business and have built a business that is in line with that ambition to become that pure-play buy-side investment firm. We are much more international today than we have been a few years ago. We are much more diversified by asset class. This was a very important target to us to be strongly diversified and very credible in each of the asset classes, in multi-asset class, in fixed income, in equity. And I think a very strong proof point to that was the fact that we were able to deliver net new money growth in all asset classes in H1.</p><p>We are also -- have a strongly changed pattern on our revenue side. Now with 60% recurring commission, within the commission part, we are heavily above 80% of recurring commission. Our net interest contribution is down to 6.4%. So we have really transformed ourselves from the revenue pattern into a buy-side investment firm, and we are happy with the progress that we made on this side. How did we do against the more qualitative targets and against the strategic ambitions? I already commented on growth and market share, where we delivered. We also delivered on our market shares in public distribution.</p><p>On drive efficiency, I also commented, and our CFO will be back with more details. Then in terms of brand, 3 years ago, we launched our 1 brand strategy with the new look and the new brand language that we used. And we are happy with the impact that we're getting from that. So as 1 of the proof points, we have risen 11 ranks in the European Fund Brand Top 50 Ranking, where we are now at top 21. So the brand starts to show its power in terms of attracting clients to the Vontobel platform. We see also upticks though not yet to the level where we have the ambition to go into the future on our social media channels.</p><p>How have we done in delivering the Vontobel experience to our clients? I think we have been pretty consistent in rolling out the brand globally across all touch points. And we have made a major step in moving the whole institutional business to 1 global CRM system. And we will be back with an update on that in the next phase. We intend to move our whole book of business to 1 consistent global CRM system, a clear prerequisite for success in the digital age.</p><p>In terms of empower people, we are happy that we get strong feedback. We regularly pulse our people. Our people are our most important asset. And Caroline will give you more insights into that. We made progress. We are and will remain the employer of choice in our industry. Now having reached this position and analyzing the environment, we came clearly to the conclusion that we wanted to step up our game 1 step further and actually look at this environment, which looks full of challenges and trying to transform this change into opportunity for our clients, for you as shareholders, for us as a firm.</p><p>When we look into the environment, a few things stick out. Saving is dead. Zero or negative interest rates are here to stay. Investing is the new saving. That creates an environment where the need for advice and professional solutions in terms of managing money has never been as much in demand as it is today and as it will remain in demand for the decade to come. And that is testified by the allocations of private people, but it is also testified by where the global pension gap is moving. At the same time, clients change how they interact with us. They decide on timing, on journey, on touch points, and we have adopt to that environment.</p><p>We took this challenge seriously and said this is the time now to even think more long-term than we did so far. So we get rid of the 3-year planning cycle that we shared with you and that we were used to. And we adopted an even longer-term vision. So we have developed what we call internally a Lighthouse that describes how do we want to be, how do we want to look like, what do we achieve to become by 2030.</p><p>And that is a very clear goalpost towards which we work in 2-year cycles that gives us clear priorities, more agility and more flexibility on that journey towards our Lighthouse. That Lighthouse is condensed in that ambition to become this pure-play buy-side investment firm with these 4 strategic levers.</p><p>In order to reap the full benefit, the full potential of that vision, we decided to align our setup and the way how we work internally. We have built a collaborative model that brings out the best from an expert-led organization. And we commit to very clear performance management, very clear priorities over a 2- year cycle, which we will share with you now over the next hours to come.</p><p>So what does that Lighthouse thinking bring to the table? First and foremost, it focuses our minds. It tells us also what we don't do. It creates a strong pull towards change. And it gives context and guidance to the whole firm. So the thinking behind that Lighthouse, the content is shared across the firm to make sure that everybody joins the vision, and then we can work with a fast-moving and powered organization that where -- in which everybody thinks and acts as an owner of this company and moves a common purpose forward.</p><p>In more detail, what does that Lighthouse spell out? We want to become 1 of the most respected global investment firm, a completely client-centric organization. We strongly believe that through time, digital data and analytics will have to be seamlessly interwoven with every client experience, with every process, with every touch point that we bring to our clients. We are and will remain investment-led, fully committed to high conviction, active investing with strong and best-in-class access to alpha, beta and income sources of return.</p><p>We think and act in ecosystems, which are the new environment for building solutions for our clients. We strongly believe that the disintermediation of capital markets will continue, and we want to play a role in that with our platforms and with the way we interact with ecosystem partners. We want to expand strongly the footprint, both in the U.S. and in selected Asian countries, as we are strongly convinced that fast forward in 10 years the U.S. will still remain the largest and most important fee pool in our industry as at the same time Asia will outpace everything else in terms of growth.</p><p>We continue our journey to a capital-light business model, and also in 10 years, we will be fiercely independent, family controlled and bring that unique combination to you of being listed and, therefore, accountable to investors like you, but having the stability, the long-term vision of controlling shareholder, which gives us a very entrepreneurial platform.</p><p>Now in order to reap the benefit of that Lighthouse, we decided to adopt the way we work. So we built on the 1 side, client units, which are dedicated areas that have only 1 thing in mind, how to best serve the client. They are the interface to the client. Client centricity is obviously an end-to-end endeavor across the whole organization. But you need an interface, a window to clients and markets. And all of these client units tap into big, attractive and growing fee pools in the selected markets.</p><p>We have then grouped our organization in what we call centers of excellence. Why is this important? This is important to attract, retain, nurture and build the best specialists in each and every capacity and capability that we need. Great investors want to work with great investors. The same is true for great IT people, great data scientists, great risk managers.</p><p>So these centers of excellence create an environment where we can attract and build the best talent in our industry. And around that, we have built a collaborative model, one firm, one P&amp;L, one Vontobel to bring the best to each and every client according to her or his needs. At the core of this model is our investment capability. And we have now a very diversified and very strong lineup of boutiques.</p><p>We strongly believe in the multi-boutique setup, and we will remain true to it. I'm also happy to report that over the last 3 years, we have invested in this core capability. Only companies that invest in their core capabilities will win the future. And as of today, we now have 300 investment professionals out of 2,000 people located in our investment hubs from New York to London to Zurich to selected European cities and then ever more so to Asia.</p><p>We are building on a number of very concrete success factors on which you will also get more details and more insights in the Asset Management and investing part dedicated to active investing, early mover on ESG and a very credible supplier of ESG solutions to our clients. We have become an emerging markets leader, and we are privileged to have investors with very long tenures and very long track records with us.</p><p>Now I want to illuminate the growth potential of our firm and of our business plans by going along the structure of the 4 client units. And I will keep shorter on these client units on which you will get a more detailed update and insight this afternoon. So Asset Management, tremendous growth in H1, very strong growth track record over the last years at a very sensible and very robust margin of 42.</p><p>Very distinctive value creation with outstanding products in the multi-boutique environment and very clear and tangible growth opportunities in regions, EMEA, U.S., Asia and in targeted client segments, especially the global banks, which have become 1 of the key demand pockets for active investment solutions.</p><p>Platforms &amp; Services, the area where we serve smaller intermediaries and banks with our structured product offering. We have the privilege to serve globally 490 banks with structured product solutions and 460 independent asset managers or IFAs with our full range of investment offering, starting from funds to structured products to custody and execution services.</p><p>We had sensible growth. We are convinced that we can do much more. We are now a top 6 player in Switzerland. The market for external asset managers in Switzerland is big. We are now a top 6 player. We have the ambition to become top 4. We have decided to set up the business also in Singapore and Hong Kong, which we see as an emerging market for external asset managers.</p><p>And with our structured product platforms, both our own open architecture platform as well as with our dedicated digital pricing services, we serve banks in Switzerland, in Germany, in Hong Kong, in Singapore and in selected other markets. And we see strong potential to win further market share and to build business with this buy-side partners.</p><p>Wealth Management. Again, here, you will get more details from Georg. Just a few highlights. I think the composition and the stability of the margin that we have delivered over the last year clearly shows that our boutique approach, our high-quality approach and our investment-led offering works. With a recurring commission margin of 47 basis points, we have a very strong industry position.</p><p>That is driven by 3 key value creation drivers: a fully client-centric advisory process, a proprietary multi-asset class inspired investment approach, which we call 3-alpha and a very transparent and need-based customer-friendly pricing model. We see significant growth potential going forward. We are confident that we will be back to deliver the historic growth levels after having suffered for different reasons for the last 18 months.</p><p>We have created a fourth client unit last December and announced that where we have bundled everything which is direct-to-consumer through primarily digital channels. There, we have a strong starting point, which is the business of public distribution, which has done CHF 90 million revenues in H1. We have a strong pan-European offering. We have a strong footprint and a promising footprint in Hong Kong, from which we can start.</p><p>We have a number of well-established platforms that attract significant interest from self-guided investors, the leading 1 being derinet that attract 70,000 users on a monthly basis. And we have built and innovated a number of digital assets over the last years, which we now have pooled in this client unit with 3 main growth ideas and initiatives going forward.</p><p>First, extend our footprint and our success in public distribution of structured products; second, scale the existing platforms and solutions for these type of investors to make our platforms the home for the investments of our clients; and then third, go towards a fully integrated direct-to-consumer digital offering to help the man on the street to invest credibly for his freedom, for his independence, for his future.</p><p>There are 2 other key centers of excellence, which I would like to highlight. One is Structured Solutions &amp; Treasury, on which you will also get the more detailed brief this afternoon. We have bundled everything that is related to risk management and risk transformation in one center of excellence. So we now support our client units and our clients with one center of excellence for everything that is related to leverage, to risk mitigation, to risk transformation. And we bundle the capabilities of our own balance sheet, of the capital markets and of the risk transformation tools that capital markets offer to us for the benefit of our client.</p><p>Today, 70% of this business is done through digital investing, 20% is done with 490 banks and the 460 external asset managers, and 10% is used by our own Wealth Management, for which, obviously, risk management and risk transformation is an important part of the offering. Then technology and services, we are strongly believers that technology is an enabler of a successful future. Therefore, we have taken a number of significant steps or are about to take further steps on that road.</p><p>One, I already quickly touched, one CRM system across the firm. It's the only way to bring a multi-channel client experience across the whole life cycle of a client to the market. It's a must-have for every successful company in the digital age. And we have already moved the institutional business to this infrastructure. We will now move the private client business to this infrastructure.</p><p>Behind that is one global platform, hosted on our private cloud. So every workstation across the Vontobel firm is hosted from 1 private cloud, and that has heavily supported us now also during COVID. We have also built, and I will leave the details to Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois, 1 big data and analytics platform across the firm. Within technology and services, we deliberately also invest in tech skills, having now more or less 100 full stack developers, data analysts, cloud engineers. So top-notch tech competencies.</p><p>We think that we can do that journey into the future with recurring investments of around CHF 60 million on a yearly basis, which is more or less the current speed that we have now. Because cloud technology and the newest technology tools, they favor not the big ones, they favor the fast movers, and we intend to use that potential.</p><p>Now let me turn to the fourth element that I cited, which is a very clear set of priorities for 2020 to '22. Priority One, deliver the Vontobel experience. It's a commitment to a journey on which we have now been for a number of years. We have now started to build a number of tools and prerequisites in order to deliver that with the utmost impact, and Elodie will give you more insights into how we do that, especially from a marketing perspective.</p><p>Second, deliver a pure-play investment firm to all clients. We are investment-led and client-centric at the same time. And obviously, the quality of our investment offering is a key prerequisite in order to defend and command the margins that we have been able to deliver over the last years, and that we intend to continue to deliver going forward. We will look into 2 examples, our 2 biggest client units, Asset Management and Wealth Management, how we deliver that investment-led approach to these clients. But obviously, in our new setup, all our clients will feel and breathe the same commitment to being an investment-led firm.</p><p>Then we also deliberately said we don't think now for 10 years in a Lighthouse environment and then go back and optimize everything on a short-term 2-year basis. So in these 2 years, we have deliberately set us goals that will not all of them fully pay back on the bottom line in these 2 years, but will give us the right to play in the next 2-year phase and in the next 2-year phase, on that journey towards that Lighthouse vision.</p><p>And these tipping points, as we call them, are: crack the global bank segments, which is important to build above-average global growth, you will get more insights into that; build a strong regional anchor in the U.S. and Asia; harvest Asia, not from a distribution side, but from a key source of alpha, which will impact the way how we prioritize and build investment capabilities; assemble a convincing and differentiating ultra-high net worth offering; and then from that idea of having pooled the capabilities of our own balance sheet and the potential of the whole capital market offering to crack the lending-led competition in servicing the most demanding ultra-high net worths.</p><p>Fourth priority, deliver the power of technology, data and analytics, here Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois will bring you more insights, and on the talent side you will be in better hands with Caroline than in my own. So that's it from my side with the overview, how we came to here, where we are, what is our ambition, why did we make the decision for a Lighthouse, why did we move to another setup, and what are the key priorities, and where do we see the convincing growth potential across all client units for our firm.</p><p>I gladly now hand over to Elodie, who joins us to give you more insights into how we deliver the Vontobel experience. Thank you.</p><p>ELODIE DUVALDESTIN, HEAD OF MARKETING ASSET MANAGEMENT, VONTOBEL HOLDING AG: Thank you, Zeno. I'm Elodie Duvaldestin. I'm heading Marketing for Asset Management, and I'm happy to be here today to talk to you about Vontobel experience, how we deliver it to client prospect globally and across all our client units.</p><p>So we deliver the Vontobel experience in every client journey. And as there is not 1 single touch point that is more important globally for our clients across client units, our aim is to optimize client experience across every touch point. In order to do that, as mentioned already, we use one global CRM across client units. It's a key element in our setup to ensure we work globally with a global operation. However, we follow standard and enforce data privacy regulation globally, such as GDPR as well as followed Swiss banking secrecy, again, while running global operations.</p><p>We are using Salesforce as a planned data source. However, much more than that, this is working to reuse daily to interact on client and prospect 360 ways across the organization. To deliver the Vontobel experience, we build journeys that match investment demands from our clients with our investment solutions and capabilities. The Vontobel experience goes way beyond our home market. And we work to increase brand awareness in all our focused markets in Europe, in the U.S. and in selected Asian countries.</p><p>So what do I mean when I talk about optimizing the client experience across every touch point? Some touch point are physical. Some of them are digital. Like we've seen with COVID, the digital touch points became really critical in maintaining traditional relationship management activities. So we need to work on all of these touch points from awareness to loyalty with our clients. However, a great client experience starts from the client. So while I quite like this visualization, what may be true for a client will be different from another.</p><p>And looking at a client experience with us, it will probably start at an event, for example, working -- coming to a fair like FINANZ'20 in Switzerland or (foreign language) in Italy. Or you may come to 1 of our digital events like the 1 we're having today, can be for our Platform &amp; Services unit, can be for our Asset Management clients, could be for Wealth Management client. That's their choice. The client decide how they interact with us. We have to be ready to give them the best experience possible across all those touch points.</p><p>Then she or he might pick up their favorite Financial Times or another news provider like Reuters. If she picks up The Financial Times, they may come across 24, our U.K. based fixed income boutique. And they may read about what we think about inflation from these boutique. Or they may go on Reuters and on Reuters come across what our Quality Growth boutique thinks, an equity-based boutique headquartered in New York, about the China versus U.S. war.</p><p>Again, they are in the driving seat. We are not. However, our work is to be ready to deliver them the best experience, however, they choose to interact with us. So in the end, the real journey is far from the nice, smooth design we had on the previous slide. And in order to optimize this journey, we need to go beyond traditional approaches. Because it's all about every client, wherever they are. So we need a data-driven approach to do that and deliver the edge.</p><p>So today, data is really at the heart of the decision we make when we deliver client experience. We use data, data from our website, data from our emailing, from our social media, from our event, to optimize the content we deliver to our client, we originated from our investment boutiques and investment centers. However, every time we publish and pushed out the message, we learn from our clients, from our prospect, what they like, how they like to hear about us, and what's the best way for us to reach them in various geographies and across different segments. So it's really an iterative process here.</p><p>We also use data to optimize our multichannel campaigns. As mentioned, the client is in the driving seat. And depending on the channel, depending on the culture they're in, they will choose to interact with us differently. Using data, we can manage the best way to promote our messages, so that we make sure it reach our target audience.</p><p>Finally, we use data to enhance our relationship management. We're in a world today where client expect us to know them. They expect us to get it. And at the same time, we see an increasing development of self-serving patterns. They go online. They compare offerings. They compare IDs. They compare messages. So it's only when we can get together, the sales part message and touch point, which happen on the marketing side, through websites, through e-mail, through social media.</p><p>With the sales touch point when a relationship manager calls a client or when they meet them when they can, that's only when we put those 2 together that we can have a 360 vision of the client interaction and how we interact with Vontobel. Doing so allow us to have more relevant contact and journeys with each of our clients and prospects.</p><p>So what is it we do better at Vontobel? We have 1 brand. This 1 brand strategy makes it more efficient and more impactful when we build brand awareness across our core countries. We have strong investment content. This content originate for our multiple boutiques and investment centers. This makes us relevant to investor across investment challenges, across asset classes.</p><p>In addition to that, we are also launching a Vontobel Investment Institute. This think tank will generate impactful content around private and professional investor challenges and will also help us further support our strong reputation.We run integrated and multichannel campaigns. There are end-to-end from investor challenges, to specific client and prospect solutions. This multichannel approach allow us to bring Vontobel's value and messaging into the client ecosystem, making sure we're client-centric and we interact on their terms, according to their habits and their choices.</p><p>Finally, we are data-driven, with one CRM, a 360 tool enabling us to communicate across the organization about client, lead and prospect across touch point. We measure journeys. We measure touch point. We measure content. And that's enable us client-centric, fact-driven enhancement of the Vontobel journey.</p><p>Thank you so much. Now I would like to hand over to Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois R\u00c3\u00bcf to talk further about data and how that help us being a data-driven company.</p><p>FRANCOIS RUF, HEAD OF DATA, AI &amp; MACHINE LEARNING, VONTOBEL HOLDING AG: Thank you very much, Elodie. So I'm going to talk about tech, data, AI, analytics and how this is going to help our business to do better and do more. Now as Zeno also already outlined, Vontobel has a very strong IT backbone. So we talked about the one CRM strategy. We have top-notch execution and trading platforms. And we have made smart investment into digital offerings like our wealth -- digital wealth offering, Volt or our new baby, Volt 3a digital pension solution.</p><p>But what we have also learned from the big tech companies out there that this is not enough anymore. The best companies out there, they can leverage the data to deliver better products, to deliver better services, better user experiences, and to automate processes that have not been able before to automate. Now you can also ask yourself, why is this so important? Now in a digital age, the data is the only context that you have about your customers. So if you want to have a meaningful discussion with your customers, you need to be able to do this advanced analytics based on this data.</p><p>Now this is what we call a data-driven company, and this is the path we have followed now for 2.5 years. And we're super proud of our data science and data engineering team that we have built up. So these are more than 20 specialists now in this field. It's a very young team. It's a very diverse team. We have over 9 nationalities. So this is from all over Europe that we acquired the best talents out there.</p><p>Mainly, they are coming from math or computer science or are physics people. But skill and talent alone is not enough. Secondly, we have also mastered to a very high degree to fully leverage the cloud. So our one analytics platform is fully based on the cloud with the latest technologies available, like real-time streaming, data lakes, machine learning. And this is also what Zeno has outlined that, nowadays, even a mid-sized company, the technology is not the blocker anymore.</p><p>And thirdly, and this is also, I think, really important because many companies, I think, have done a mistake here. If they build this advanced analytics AI solutions, they do a lot of POCs, they do small labs, where they are experimenting. From the get-go, we focused on the biggest problems that we have solved to make a real business impact. And we are also proud that we have already 5 real use cases in production.</p><p>I want to give you 1 of these cases here. This is all about structured product and how we do quoting. This is a big data problem because we have a lot of products out there. And firstly, on the tech side, we have shown through pandemic, where you have super high volumes, that actually we're still out there in the market, capable of giving quotes. So we stayed in there, and this was very much valued by our customers.</p><p>At the same time, now we're able to use analytics to actually optimize the quoting. And this is done on the cloud with the latest machine learning technologies and remarkably is that the core of this solution, which is like 2 billion records that need to be processed per day or up to 40,000 records a second, was mainly built by 1 person. And then you can ask yourself, how is this possible? In the old world that would be completely different. But right now, with all the cloud technologies, you can actually scale out your solution easily.</p><p>And then, finally, our definition of a data-driven company. We really focus on 3 areas. One is the core investment performance. So we help our portfolio managers to make the best decisions out there with the best technology. Secondly, client experience. We heard it from Elodie. Data is at the core. So we use the technology to have the data ready to know what our customers want. And thirdly, this is all about efficiency to automate processes.</p><p>Thank you very much, and I'm looking forward for your questions. And now I'm going to hand over to my colleague, Caroline, who will talk about a great workplace. Thank you.</p><p>CAROLINE KN\u00c3\u00b6RI, HEAD HR, VONTOBEL HOLDING AG: Thanks, Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois. Hi, everyone. So I'm here today to talk about how we are creating a great workplace. And let me say 1 sentence first. Great workplace starts with great people. We do believe that if we have inspired employees, talented people, we are going to have great ambassadors for Vontobel. And those great ambassadors are going to attract other people to join. And this is the virtuous cycle we want to create at Vontobel.</p><p>So how is this great workplace going to look like? Our EVP comes down to 3 words: engage, excite, exceed. And this is about creating a workplace where people make a difference. They act as owners, and they're rewarded for what they do. They drive and they don't wait to be driven. This is about creating a workplace where people are obsessed with creating the best experience for their clients and delivering the right solutions.</p><p>This is a workplace where people are inspired, inspired by their leaders, by their colleagues, and they feel they can be self architects of the workplace. There is a good news with it. Where we engage, where we play, we are coming across as a strong employer. The last 12 months, we've made it to the high-performing norm. And this is according to Towers Willis Watson (sic) [Willis Towers Watson], the place where great companies are based on the results of our employee surveys.</p><p>We're also ranked very high as an employer of choice for -- by those professional medias that have been assessing us. So -- and now how do we build this great place further? At Vontobel, we use a wheel of a great workplace. And this is really, if you want the frame of reference for us on how we drive work.</p><p>I'll give you a few example of what we do in each space. Let me start with values. Mission and values is what I see to be the absolute must of employees engagement. At the beginning of this year, we have shared our company goals with all employees. And we've asked each employee to define his personal objective based on how they can best contribute to the company goal.</p><p>We also have global virtual town halls on a quarterly basis and regular lunches with leader. Those are cross-functional, and are here to foster not only common vision, common mission, but also common values. Second, great people. As I've said, attracting and hiring great people and talents for Vontobel has been an absolute priority for us. First thing we've done is we've enhanced our sourcing channels in the last years. And we've built a team of experts in the recruiting space that know and master each business area.</p><p>Our recruiting team is based in Zurich and London, and they represent the diversity we want to create at Vontobel. To attract a broader pool of talent and a more diverse pool of talent, there are a few things we've done. First, we've revamped our candidate journeys. You actually do not engage the same way depending on which profile you want to attract. In the tech space, for example, we have entirely revisited the platforms we're using.</p><p>We've been participating to HackZurich last year. We're using WomenHack, HackerX to recruit talents. We're also using CodinGame as a tool to assessing talents in the tech space, in the first place. Very different way to interact that you would with a relationship manager, for example. We've also rewritten our job specifications and do train interviewers to be more aware of their bias.</p><p>Lastly, we've enforced a 50-50 male-female rule when it comes to recruiting for senior role. We want to increase our diversity. Talking now about young talent, we do have an existing successful Graduate Trainee Program. Our goal for the coming years is to make it a more international, diverse and tech-focused experience.</p><p>Third, trust. Trust comes with communication, open communication and a feedback culture. As an example, for the second year in the row, we have run a Manager Survey. This is employees giving feedback to their managers, results being shared transparently with teams and then openly discussed among teams. Fourth, growth. We call the make or the break of a great culture. If you want -- there are just 2 good reasons why you should invest in growth and creating growth opportunities. On 1 side, it massively enhance retention, and it's just also results in making the workplace better skilled.</p><p>So this year, what we've done, we've decided we wanted better leaders and we've entered in a partnership with IMD and send 130 leaders to join a leadership program with IMD. We have realized that people learned other ways right now. We've added to our learning offer the platform, Degreed. This is an online learning platform that people can access and self develop and learn. And as best learning happens on the job, we have also been promoting internal mobility and launched a new internal job portal this year.</p><p>Last but not least, recognition. Recognition is a nice thing for the people being recognized, obviously, but what it tells is what success looks like in a company. We do firmly believe that through our promotions, through our performance processes, we equally want to reward the what and the how. And we do look at Vontobel values as a frame for assessment in everything we do in this space. Those are our 5 must-have of a great workplace and also our commitment to our workforce.</p><p>Thank you for your attention. And I'm now handing over to Zeno for Q&amp;As and a summary. Thank you.</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: Thank you very much. So please join me for the Q&amp;A session. And we tried to give you an overview in this first half on our Lighthouse, how we want to get there and about the priorities and also now some deep dives into 3 out of these 5 priorities. And we are happy to have your questions now.</p><p>And there is a function on your Internet device in order to type in the question that should then be forwarded to us, so that we can answer to them.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: So I would read the -- I don't know. Do people see the questions on the -- so okay. So we start with the first question of M\u00c3\u00a1t\u00e9 from UBS. Could you clarify how you intend to crack the lending-led competition in Wealth Management and AM market? Are you referring to a third-party lending platform that is connecting third-party lenders with your clients in need of a loan? What type of loans?</p><p>So I'm happy to comment on that. First of all, we do not intend to change our risk appetite. We will remain within the risk appetite that we have delivered over the last years. We will not join the race of becoming lending-led. We are investor-led, and we will remain so. However, it stroke us of being a little bit awkward. In each and everything we do, usually, in serving private clients, we have learned as an industry over the last years and many, many years to come to be actually a open architecture and open platform, being it from the investment solutions we offer, being it from best execution, being it, in our case we opened up our structured product platforms for our own proprietary channels. But when it comes to lending, actually, every 1 of us seems to be proprietary close job but by leveraging only their own balance sheet.</p><p>Now our balance sheet is a pretty conservatively run lending platform. And therefore, we decided to work towards an offering where we actually open up. So 1 of the approaches we're running is customer funding, where we say, okay, whatever we can, what can be securitized, gets a much broader competitive offer and better pricings. So what we intend to is that we will bring to our clients best advice and then an open competitive offering, combining different prices, different offers and the full depth of the capital market. That's where we want to go.</p><p>So let's move on to the question of Daniel Regli. Yes. Okay. We can go to Page 7 to look into the numbers that Daniel is referring to. So the question is, I would now that drop in H1, and perhaps I would ask our CFO to crunch some additional numbers. And if it is different to my thoughts, we will give you an update in part 3, Daniel. But I would say they dropped more because we had this huge drop in assets in H1. We had this jigsaw of asset levels. And at the end of March, we were much more down than what you would actually think when you look at the end of June numbers.</p><p>And as most of these fees are accounted on a monthly basis, we obviously suffered from the significant drop that we had -- that everybody had in the industry when markets tested to lows -- when markets tested to lows in H1. So I would say that is the main driver for the stronger drop in absolute numbers in H1 on the recurring. And we look at this as a price to be paid for 2 things: one, that's what you predominantly are interested in, the reliability, the visibility, the recurring aspect of the fees, but we also like recurring fees because it's the -- our fees that are in basis points linked to the assets, we think it's the easiest and best way of interest alignment with our clients.</p><p>And what is the optimal degree?</p><p>We are actually offering to clients both options. Obviously, on the Asset Management, the institutional side, it's recurring only. On the private side, we give people a choice. And we -- I don't expect that we will ever go to 100% recurring. But I think with the discussions that will continue in the public space and in the industry about the interest alignment and about simplicity and transparency, I would expect to share across the industry to further increase.</p><p>We are now already at 85%, 89% of recurring. It probably also depends a little bit on the revenue mix of the different client units. We have no intention to nudge that in the 1 or the other direction. We offer the options to clients who want to have a choice. But again, in principle, we like basis point fees in relation to assets, clear, simple interest alignment; and second, recurring, reliable, highly visible fees going forward. We will be back with a check on why these fees dropped in H1, but I would suppose it's the drop in assets.</p><p>Okay. Now I have some technical problems here to scroll the questions. Okay. Good. Then that's it for -- no, we do have other questions. We're having a little bit -- the hybrid choreography of our setup is challenging all of us. So most is digital, then a few things are okay. So thank you for your answer. Can you elaborate more? How do you intend to play a role in the disintermediation of capital markets?</p><p>Well, 1 of the points is actually that lending thing. So we just think that markets will continue to -- that -- are -- to be a little bit provocative here on a Wednesday afternoon. We -- most of you probably like digital business models and platform business models. And most of us are probably users of Uber, and we all are convinced how comfortable it is that demand and supply matches itself directly on platforms without having an intermediary to be paid. And we all admired evaluations these platform business models command and then we move on.</p><p>But we should sometimes think about our first 2 lessons in microeconomics that most of us spend some time in life on and who is the intermediary of the whole capitalized system. It's actually the bank. That's the intermediary. So why should not the intermediary as such, driven by technology, by ever lower transaction costs, by ever more accessible technology come under pressure? Where do actually intermediary fees -- where will they continue to be paid? And we think that's a very long term, very reliable trend. Securitization was probably put into question in the global financial crisis in 2009, 2010, but it was not stopped. It will continue.</p><p>And in that disintermediation, we see opportunities. We see opportunities in terms of the platforms we can offer. We see opportunities in terms of being more competitive in servicing clients without being restricted to our own limited risk capacity on the lending side. We see possibilities in this why we also move direct-to-consumer with our digital offering because, obviously, also on the way towards direct-to-consumer businesses, there is a lot of intermediation still going on. So we think we have to be ready and to be prepared for these developments.</p><p>On the back-office side, we would only see ourselves as a user. We would expect there that disintermediation continues too perhaps very long, long, long down the road with that innovation of distributed ledger technology. There we would simply see us as an investment firm, as a user of cheaper and more user-friendly technology. So we pick and choose the fight on the disintermediation of value change where we want to be a user and where we want to be a provider and active player.</p><p>Yes. So a question on the CHF 60 million, yes, that's the budget for project costs, and it covers run the bank and change the bank. So we are able to cover regulatory adjustments and innovations and building the future, but it's not the maintenance and the running of the systems. That's separate. But that's kind of the investment budget yearly that we need in order to adopt our platforms to the future.</p><p>Good. We think we covered -- there is another question here on mail coming in on diversity. So as you can't read it openly as it was forwarded by mail, I will quickly read it. Vontobel still does not have a woman on the management board. What is the reason why there are no women in the management board? The new Head of Digital Investing is also a man again. How does Vontobel intend to become more diverse?</p><p>So I'm happy to quickly keep cough on this, and then I would also hand over to Caroline for more details on how we try to tackle this first. And perhaps 3 points from my side. We are not happy with where we are, point one. Second point, we're not optimizing for gender diversity only. We are optimizing for diversity of thoughts. And there are different walks of life and different aspects that contribute to a diversity of thought. Nevertheless, obviously being a gender diverse is 1 of the drivers for our diversity of thoughts. And third, we made some progress. So we increased -- and I will leave the numbers to Caroline. We increased gender diversity in senior roles, but we acknowledge that we are on a journey.</p><p>Maybe I ask you to add your thoughts to this?</p><p>CAROLINE KN\u00c3\u00b6RI: Sure. Practically, I'm not happy either where we are. I think this is a journey. It takes time. I've mentioned a few initiatives we've been running. I mean, 1 of them is really when we look at senior hires, like have diversity slates of candidates. We apply this rule of 50-50 for senior roles. And I also do believe we need to act at various level of the organization as much in pipeline building, GTP programs aim to be 50-50 and international same for our apprentice program. And then making sure in every single HR processes, performance reviews, hiring, promotion, we do apply a diversity less, not only about women, but looking at age, internationality and gender.</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: Thank you. There is another question from Citi. How does the CHF 60 million compare versus the prior strategy?</p><p>It actually compares almost unchanged to what we've done over the last 1 to 2 years. But in comparison to the past, it's higher. We clearly had to change our mind here. We had been spending more than this in the early 2000s when we needed to upgrade the back office system. That was also at the time when infrastructure and IT costs were not coming fractionally priced as a service from the cloud, but packed and priced in bulks in our own back offices.</p><p>And then we went into a phase where we actually now in hindsight, that was not the right thing to do. But at that time, that was what we did. We looked at IT as an efficiency tool. And we limited IT to being an efficiency tool, and we brought down investment costs to a certain degree, up and out till 2011, '12, '13. And then we realized that IT becomes ever more and technology become ever more important on the touch point with clients, on the client experience, on distributing and reaching clients, respectively, as Elodie has pointed out, adopting and reacting to whenever and wherever the client decides to interact with us.</p><p>And thirdly, technology has moved to a level where we can actually improve our service such as quoting services that Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois has pointed out. And we, therefore, decided to upgrade our investment appetite into technology. We think that CHF 60 million on a yearly basis is still a very sensible number for a company in our size. And we think we get a lot of results and impact out of this CHF 60 million, but we see the need to move to that slightly higher cruising level. And in order to being able to deliver top-notch infrastructure and solutions, but we are convinced that the benefit in terms of client experience, leveraging our experts and being more relevant to our clients will more than reward us for the investments we do.</p><p>Okay. No, that's a question I have been hoping to get it. Do you think you will be able to compete with your bigger peers with much deeper pockets for IT and technology?</p><p>Yes, absolutely. And I don't know then after Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois, who understands more about technology than I do, wants to chime in and add a few thoughts. But let me start. We think when -- let's scale back 10 years. 10, 15 years ago, corporates were having the better technology than consumers because only corporates had the money to build server rooms, to run mainframes, to have what was it called the AS/400 from IBM somewhere in a freezing room.</p><p>And today, all of you may not -- because I'm not allowed, it would interfere with the digital solution. But most of you probably have your mobile handy. And behind that mobile is probably some of the leading technology stacks available nowadays. So top-notch technology is now available at the fraction of the price and can be sourced as a service from the top 5, 10, 15 technology companies in the world.</p><p>And the scarcity is not the money you can spend. The scarcity in our experience is the people who are able to unlock the potential of this new platform. So we see actually leveraging technology limited by talent and by our ability to change and move. We think we're not bad at it, but I think we could get better. And it's not limited by money, actually. So we think we can compete very nicely. But perhaps, Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois, it makes sense if you add a few thoughts about the potential of, for example, cloud technology.</p><p>FRANCOIS RUF: Yes, absolutely. So I think you summarized this really well. I don't think this is a limiting factor. If you think about what was built by a handful of people and how this is possible, right, is really if you can fully leverage the cloud, you can scale with the cloud. You don't have this huge investment costs anymore in the beginning of a project because you can grow on demand with your service.</p><p>And also what I see, if a midsized company, we can move faster than the big ships. And also this comes with -- if you think about all the regulations that you have out there, we're just quicker in moving. That means we can also leverage the speed within the cloud. So I really think what you have mentioned, Zeno, that this is not a limiting factor anymore.</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: And perhaps to add another start to this. When we come to investments in digital models, we don't see that the limiting factor is actually building the technology or the solutions. What we cannot do and will not do is because we're not financed by venture capital and driven by exits, but we are financed by shareholders that want to have recurring long-term value creation, we will not be willing or able to burn money on client acquisition costs. But there are other advantages of us coming. We have a brand. We have a reputation. We have an existing client base. And that will be then the art to leverage our heritage and our credibility in order to create digital clients without burning money underway.</p><p>Good. Thank you very much for staying with us through this socially distanced digital experience. That was part one. Thanks you all for contributing. Thank you for joining in. Thank you for your question. I hope it was helpful to all of you to grasp and judge what we here at Vontobel want to do and intend to do. We will be back at 3:00 p.m. sharp with Asset Management. Thank you.</p><p>(Break)</p><p>&lt;Presentation</p><p>AXEL JUERGEN SCHWARZER, HEAD OF ASSET MANAGEMENT, HEAD INVESTMENTS &amp; MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, VONTOBEL HOLDING AG: So good morning and good afternoon. I'd like to welcome you to the Asset Management session. This afternoon, I'm here, my name is Axel Schwarzer. I'm the Head of Asset Management. And with me is Marko R\u00c3\u00b6der, our Head of Global Sales for the Asset Management.</p><p>What I'd like to do, we'd like to split the presentation. I want to talk about products, strategy and the culture of Asset Management and where the -- where we see the growth drivers there. And then I will hand over to Marko, and -- who will talk about our client approach and where we see the growth driver in the client segments.</p><p>So to start, let me start with our favorite chart, which is what are, from our perspective, the key industry themes for an active manager and where is the growth. So -- and you see on the left side, there is another decade of low interest rates, and cash is not an asset class, and that's a great opportunity for us as an investment house because investing is the new saving. I think you will not put your money into a saving account and will be happy going forward. This is an opportunity for every active management you are looking for going forward. And then what we see, which is important for our overall position, is an increasingly divide between high-conviction asset manager and, if you will, low-cost passive factories.</p><p>Why is that the case? You can ask yourself the question, do you want to put your money on autopilot and then go home and just see what happens. We all have seen, not only due to corona, but in general, that investment needs take care, markets change, situations change, sector change, so that's why we are very convinced that this, if you will, bifurcation and high-conviction asset managers and passive factories, I'm not saying that both are not needed, but for -- to achieve the goals, particular on real investing, I think we are well positioned to leverage this trend and -- which is always nice, I guess, for all of us to understand that the margins in the business daily in active, high alpha and specialist asset classes and less. So I will come back to that later in low-cost areas.</p><p>What we always say, but I think it's very meaningful if you are an active manager, the talent is a growth driver. So the ability to attract top talents is key. I mean you don't go in a restaurant and -- just for the food. You go into a restaurant as well to get the service, the people, and the people make the difference. And we are not that different to other people. We can have -- we will not always have top products, that's clear, but we at least strive to have good products. But then the other parts, which we have seen, digital communication service, the people really, really matter. And what we have learned is not just about the people, how you assemble people as well, which we see in the second bullet point, we have to be able to put A teams together for the client, whatever the client needs. Sometimes, it's sales, sometimes it's production and sometimes, it's the service part of -- or the operation part of the business. That together makes, in my opinion, a very successful mix for our business.</p><p>And then, of course, we have the client themes. Sure, we are in the institutional business, but that's nothing new, but we are talking here about growth drivers. And for us, the global banks, I think we talked about this earlier already, is internationally because they're integrating much more, they're really global, they cover all the continents. It's one of the key growth elements and growth driver, and they organize themselves much better. They have to. The other one is the intermediaries, and we are talking here on the wholesale channel. Intermediaries becoming much more sophisticated, much more institutional to the quality of the products you have to deliver, has to be as good as in the institutional piece. And ESG becomes mainstream, that's clear, but it's very important for portfolio construction. But not only this, we see in the future that all the flow patterns will change. We have the EU regulations. We have other things. So there's a huge opportunity for asset manager, investment houses who do really ESG investing or not just like we all know, reinvesting their products.</p><p>So why we feel we are perfectly positioned to benefit from these trends? You might have heard that a long time or very often that the stable ownership structure is the most important thing for an asset manager. We hate change, and we hate in and out. So we are here for the long run, that's the foundation for active asset management. We don't go in and out. And when you look how many asset managers close funds, change strategies, merge or doing things, that's not what you want. What you want, you want to be here for the long term as we want the people here for the long term. So our people have long track records. They are very long with the firm, and this is for us the prerequisite to build the culture of our organization. And then I think it goes without saying, if you want to be a high-conviction asset manager, you have to be investment led, and that's why we feel that our investment boutiques across almost all asset classes have superior products. And we have the opportunity and the capabilities, we will see that going forward when Marko takes over to tap into all asset pools globally out of Switzerland, that's fairly unique.</p><p>We said we want to break it down for you because we are not one-off childs, is our business robust and what are our diversification driver of growth. I think that's an important thing, and I will cover the product perspective. So what does the client really think? She thinks, from a client experience, what has a leading investment firm to deliver alpha, of course, beta, yes, and yield. And I will keep reemphasizing that saving is over, investing is in and therefore, this is what the clients will expect going forward. Can we deliver? You might think, \"Oh, God, what a stupid headline: it takes 10 years to build a 10-year track record.\" But it means, at the end of the day, that we are in for the long term, and it takes time to build.</p><p>I can say it from my experience here. I mean I'm here now 10 years. It takes time to build a superior asset manager. You can't acquire, you can't just put a product out. It's the culture, it's the people, it's the tenure of the people. It's a lot of things that you have to do. And you see here, I don't want to go into the details, how long key people, it's not the only ones we have, of course, but how key people have the tenure with us in Asset Management. And this covers, and I'd like to reemphasize that, almost all the important asset classes we are working in. So we can -- no, we are not a one-trick pony, if you will, we can cover most of the relevant asset classes for the client, which you can see on the next page.</p><p>The next page shows the total inflows from 2019, which were a little bit about CHF 13 billion. And when we look at this, and I said, remember, alpha, beta and yield. And we have broken the pie a little bit in active beta. You have to be smart when you talk about passive. I said autopilot for us is not an option and shouldn't be for most of the clients. So active beta can compete with all passive and weak asset managers, which we all know as closet hackers or benchmark trackers. So that's infinitely scalable and technology led. And with Vescore and the boutique here, we are very well positioned, as we see here, to capture that kind of trend. Emerging market products, where we are one of the biggest one in active management globally out of Switzerland, we can offer alpha and yield, which means equity and fixed income products. And on the flexible side, remember, investing is the new saving, and we are in a low or negative interest rate for 10 years. We have the products who give you yield. And as you can see, it's not what I'm saying, we're hoping the client reconfirm that we are here on the right track.</p><p>This is a chart which might be a little busy, which I'd like to explain is, can we grow with a profitable margin? And what we have done here, it's the U.S. fund industry. There's nothing else, just the U.S. fund industry. And what we have seen here, we have the fees broken down by asset and equally weighted. That's important to understand because as you know, asset weighted, a big fund can dominate the entire sector, and then you don't really get good insight, and equally weighted means every fund, however the size is, counts the same. And then we have seen active and passive and all together. And I just want to show you the active equal, still good margin here. But active, basically, asset weighted, starts a little lower, which means that the big funds dominates. You could argue that big funds bring the margin down and equally weighted boutique manager, if they're really good and high conviction, can still capture higher margin. That's what I take out of that chart. So we are well underway, if we are positioned ourselves as a high-conviction manager, we capture a good margin.</p><p>This is us. And now I -- it's a disclaimer. Here, you can't compare it 1 to 1. We are talking here, when we're talking about our own book, about funds and mandates. That's why, of course, and we are talking here about the ROA, the margin a little higher on the equity side you see, not like the trend in the U.S. fund industry, which goes permanently down, we could basically keep the margins since a couple of years. On the multi-asset class side, where we have smart beta products and traditional fixed -- multi-asset class products, a margin in the area of between 28% to 35% is a very good margin. And then we have, on the fixed income side, an average margin of almost 34%, which we feel is fairly high. We have a traditional book of business, of course, with Swiss bonds and global bonds, which in the institutional space, which is a little lower. And then the products we are -- what I mentioned, which we are focusing on, the emerging market products as good as they are, deliver good margins. And this will stay, in our opinion, for the next decade.</p><p>Is there anything new from the product perspective we have? And of course, we feel product innovation, not every new product, but real product innovation can drive future growth. So -- and we have 2 things. We haven't released them yet. They're still, if you will, in the incubation case to a certain degree, is the artificial intelligence fund where we try to use big data to find out which patterns, macro patterns, have been in the world before to forecast how an asset allocation look like. We feel, and you see the performance here, that could be a very, very interesting idea going forward to make product selection, [TAA] and [ASA] better.</p><p>On the other side, where we are very convinced this will be, from the product perspective, an area of future growth is megatrends. The megatrends, I mean, there are so many, but that's -- we have to say there are competitors, which are very good in that, but this is an area where people really want to have themes, but not only asset classes where they want to invest. That's something we have, which we will open for, if you will, third-party distribution in due course.</p><p>So that's from my side, from the product side and more on the strategic side. I'm very happy to hand over to my colleague, Marko R\u00c3\u00b6der, to talk a little bit about under the same headline, robustness and diversification of growth from a regional perspective. Thank you.</p><p>MARKO RODER, GLOBAL HEAD OF SALES, VONTOBEL HOLDING AG: Thank you, Axel. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, in Europe. Good morning for those of you in the U.S. My name is Marko R\u00c3\u00b6der, Head of Sales at Asset Management. So you've just heard it, right, we looked at growth, it's resilient, it's diversity from our product side. What we're going to do now, we look from the client perspective, from the regional perspective, right? These are different engines diversifying our growth. And first, I'm going to show you some numbers so you see how our outcomes have really sort of journeyed over the past years, and then we really go into the drivers of that growth.</p><p>So we see here, these are data you can all access. These are Broadridge data. These are data we captured end of last year. All of our peers are in there, all the rivals in there, the fund side universe, and they're 1,482. And you see us finishing last year, very strong, right? We're in top 3 position. That's an amazing result. We could before the storm because you all knew that this year turned out to be quite difficult. So what we want to know is as we went into this year and we went into the year strongly, how do you go through that? And so look, this is the next snapshot. Same data. It's the Broadridge fund universe, so it includes EMEA, client flows, also Lat Am, also Asia, and you see us coming out in the top 10. So a very strong result in a totally different market situation. I think that it's quite important to see that, right, very different situations, but we have the product, we have the client reach to perform in both scenarios. Now of course, for you, the question is, can we repeat that, right, how we're going to function in yet another market scenario going forward? And to help you a bit with that, we mapped you different markets in the next slide.</p><p>We're taking the same database, but we show you really how different years have worked in fund flows. So on the left side of the slide, you see 2017, '18, '19, the entire industry performing, right? You see the cumulating net flows throughout the calendar year. And then look at that, right, I mean, 2017, an amazing year for the entire industry, right, accumulating flows throughout the year. You see 2018 starting okay-ish, getting weaker. 2019 starting weakish getting a bit better, right, not really a great year. And then you see the drama in 2020, right? So this is as different as you can have it in the industry.</p><p>On the right side, we just extracted the Vontobel numbers, right? So these are Vontobel cumulative flows throughout the calendar year. And I think this is quite powerful, really. You see us in these different market scenarios performing in every single year, right, up there in the top 10, right, with diversified flows also in the subcompartments of Broadridge fixed income equity mindset was strong. I think it's one of our amazing strengths. We don't bet on one-trick ponies. We diversify product, we diversify client reach. It's hard to kill that growth.</p><p>And that's what you saw this year, right, look at the black line here, right, of course, that's drama, right, that's painful. But we finished February great, you see that here, right, spiking up with the flows and then had a bad March like the whole industry had it. But we protected better. We didn't lose that much really. And then look at the rebound, very strong rebound. So what's carrying us here is that we've worked with clients over a decade if we have to in having trust and having our products there. And as we're rebounding, we can rely on them, yes? So I think very strong numbers here that show you how we're performing.</p><p>Now the core engines behind that is what we call the growth journeys. There's one bedrock of the growth journey, that's our sort of mother region EMEA, the region that we've performed as an Asset Management for 30 years. And you see here a very strong performance, that's our backdrop of a growth journey. These are the assets. They're driven not just by the net flows, they're driven by FX, they're driven by market and product performance, but you see them going up nicely and also in a year like 2020, they look beautiful.</p><p>So going a bit now into the themes behind that, right, and this is where we want to just make it very transparent that we believe the drivers are to deliver these numbers. And these are client themes. They are incubated and built over a long time in EMEA. But of course, we really sort of pollinate them across the globe.</p><p>So let me start with our perspective on our intermediary clients. We don't sell to them. We listen. And we don't listen fast, we listen over a decade. We need to understand their journey, their issues, their engagement with their client. So we call it a long-standing relation, and that needs to go beyond the product. The product is the ingredient now that you're talking to these clients. But then as client service demands increase, we've engaged ever deeper with these clients, and we developed what Axel touched on earlier, the A team. The A team idea is that you don't just present the portfolio manager, but you try to understand the value chain of the client and present expert across the value chain. I will give you a case study later, but just to leave you with the idea, the intermediary clients and their journey are for us a product excellence journey but also a servicing journey, also a content journey, also a marketing journey.</p><p>Now on the institutional side, you want to think about pension plan -- global consultants here. We're starting off with amazing component design. We need to be right for their allocation needs. When they have an issue, we want to be there with the right solution, the right component. So investing into our talent, as Axel mentioned earlier, and then into very clearly designed investment process, into very sharply designed alpha, beta or yield components is our strength. So here, the thorough due diligence of these clients really also helps us making our product ever better and going through the cycle with the clients on that. So why these to focus on a channel perspective here, we also brought that search for income again, right, that's been clear to us over more than a decade that income will be sort of independent client benefit so we invested here.</p><p>And there are 2 ways to bring that to our client. One is take emerging market credit, take emerging market debt, this is very clear component yield. You allocate that in and out. But we also have a product called strategic income fund, which goes to the core of client portfolios. So with such products, we help them outsource the yield production of their portfolio to us, and we stay with the client through the cycle, yes? So here are some core themes, how we're working with the client and how we're engaging with them, taking the long-term view, which, again, our stable ownership, our clear focus on amazing investment tenant is a key ingredient for that.</p><p>Now let's go into the accelerators, right? That was the backdrop of our growth, and it's -- I will show you now 3 more growth journeys that are complementing that growth, and they're all interconnected as you will see in a minute. So what you have here is our growth journey #2, these are the global banks. Now imagine the global banks as a global-integrated asset owners. They have their own distribution model, and we are the specialists supplying them with the interim side. Why is it interesting? Two statistics here. On the left side, you see just a household where it's of higher net worth, right? So we're talking about households here of $1 million or more of net worth. And look where the compound annual growth rates are, right? We sorted that by the growth rate. So it's intuitive, it's obvious, but here, you have it in the numbers, right, very strong growth in Asia Pacific, very strong growth in Lat Am. There's a good growth in the other regions, right? But of course, with our partnering with the global banks, we also get carried to their growth regions, Asia Pacific, Lat Am.</p><p>On the right side, you see our view on the U.S., the largest market in the world, both in institutional and intermediary assets. And you see in a fragmented market, it is fragmented, but you see that just the top 4 are so large, and they're all global banking partners we work with. They're so large, they're covering 16%, 17% of that market. So it is important to partner up with them in the U.S., but also to partner up across their sales regions.</p><p>So how do we do that? And that's an angle slide really to show you a bit how we engage with client. It's looking at Vontobel with a client point of view, right? It's not pushing product. It's not selling. It's listening, it's engaging. So the blue bubbles here are the value chain of a global bank, could also be of a large regional bank. So there is the fund research. There is the platform work. You have to get that right. These are the factories where we bring the product, and it's [rapper] enablement, it's compliant component and so forth. Then as we integrate deeper in support of the client, we work with their distribution, their multi-manager team, their advisory, their discretionary team, and this is where the A team comes in.</p><p>We really have met their value chain against our support services. We call that client journey mapping. So imagine each of the blue bubbles here, there can be 10, 20, 30 touch points, and we have to understand these. And that's what we do. We've mapped our client engagement process in sales force. We've done so for 6 years. So we have a very systematic near quant-driven sales process, and we measure every step in the client engagement, not to control it, but to keep learning. It's a constant learning process, what works, what doesn't, you want to improve, and you want to let your client know that you improve, yes? So as you go deeper in engaging with a global bank, with a large regional bank, you have to really deliver the services they need in their client journey.</p><p>Okay. Here's the growth journey #3, the Americas. You see just some briefs here on the right side. This is the size of the market. It's -- you all know that it's large, it's huge. We want to be present there. We have been present in America for more than 30 years. We actually have a founding team there that started Asset Management for Vontobel in the late 1980s.</p><p>So there are 3 engines there in our sort of Americas strategy. One of the North American intermediaries, very clearly linked to the global banks journey, what we are doing at the moment is we're widening our offering for the global banks in Americas. We have also strong partners. We work with Virtus, we work with American Beacon. These are long standing partnerships. They are full of trust and also a track record of joint growth, but we will supply product for banks who have a U.S. onshore presence on the intermediary side.</p><p>As we move into U.S. offshore, into Lat Am institutional, we're having 2 very different client engagements here, U.S. offshore distribution region of many of our global banking clients who are present there in Miami. Lat Am is an institutional, a pension plan engagement journey. We've been present in Lat Am for more than 10 years. We're a specialist in emerging market fixed income, emerging market equities there. So that is a long journey of growth which we continue. We love that region, and we're going to continue to be there.</p><p>And then finally, our founding channel there in the Americas, North American institutional, it's an equities business. It's a strong equity business. And like on the intermediary side, we're adding more of our competencies to the U.S. so we're expanding the multi-boutique presence in the U.S.</p><p>So here is the growth journey for the largest market in the world. And now let's look at the fastest-growing market in the world, our Asia Pacific growth journey and again, some regional initiatives. So the #1 investment area, we're going through that. This year is very exciting. It's us building out the A team I mentioned earlier, the engagement onshore with our global banking partners, with the regional banks. So A team means not just a portfolio manager or a salesperson. It's a compliance person, it's a marketing person, it's a platform person. So investing into teams in Singapore, Hong Kong to bring product, but also to bring content and bring service, very connected to the global banks journey I mentioned earlier. We have been present for more than 10 years in Australia, this is an institutional engagement journey. We're working with the superannuation funds there. We're also onshore with commingled funds to allow smaller flows into our strategies. We offer equities, fixed income, sustainable equities. We have a good presence also with the regional consultants.</p><p>And then finally, Japan, a market that is large. It's very professional. We've been there for 10 years, but we also want to go deeper into the market. So this year, we opened an office. We've got the license right, we onboarded a new team there. So also in Japan, we want to expand our growth and bring the journey of growth you saw earlier, the diversified growth, to the market onshore.</p><p>Now that brings me to the end of the growth journeys. I have a bit of sort of anecdotal input here to finish off the presentation, and then I will hand over to Axel for the summary. But I thought it's nice to show you a bit how we work in our client engagement culture. So look, I mean, that's ketchup up. Okay, we're talking about investing here, but there is an analogy right? You might have the best ketchup in the world, if you don't get that out of the glass bottle and you have a problem, right, you might not enjoy it. You might not even buy it, right? If you turn it around and you make the bottle more friendly to get the ketchup out, you have a good product. So it's ketchup in something else, right? So think about that as an analogy, how you bring investment products to clients. Without the product, you're not in the game. With the product, you're only in the game if you understand their value chain and how to engage with it.</p><p>Now what's interesting is that we had the aspiration to be best-in-class when it comes to the entire client service. And the inspiration, we actually didn't find in the financial industry or asset management, right? We really looked outside. So one of the great inspirations for us has been Salesforce. We think it's an amazing firm. They're one of the world leaders in client experience, so really bring our client engagement process into an app, into a process, being systematic, doing client journey mapping, going after single touch points with the clients to improve. They inspire us. We learn from them, and now we take it on as our journey in Asset Management.</p><p>And here's the final slide. Just a case study, how that works, right? So the client engages with us, right, our silos, our organization isn't an immediate benefit to them. They access our experts, right? What we've what worked on is that, you see the green that -- I can see it, right, this is in the end what the client experiences, specialists they're engaging with. They need connectivity, they need agility. This is a decade of learning, of getting these experts right. We even designed some of these teams with the client in the room. It's essential to have the client voice them as you design how you're reaching out to them. So I think one of our strength is that next to the amazing product journey that Axel showed you earlier, we found ways of engaging with the clients that build sustainable trust and then allow us to diversify our client and regional book.</p><p>So with that, I want to leave you here and hand over to Axel for the summary.</p><p>AXEL JUERGEN SCHWARZER: Thank you, Marko, very much for the insight, how we serve clients. Let me just summarize where we are. And then we are ready for question and already a couple of questions are coming up.</p><p>Stable ownership and our high-quality products, where we focus on, so we are not a broad shop, which is important, will position us very well for what, in the industry, could be secular in terms of investing in [CU] saving, and people really need advice for asset management. And either they go autopilot or they want to have the entertainment with an high-conviction asset manager, and we think this is where we want to be and where we can grow.</p><p>We marry product excellence and client-centric servicing, you heard that just right now, how we're doing this, to create a superior client performance. We think products, to a certain degree, are commodity, but client service, as I said, from the restaurant, makes the big difference going forward, even in a digital world.</p><p>And last but not least, we will continue our journey of sustained -- that's very important to us, we are not a hotshot and have 1 modern hot product, and diversified growth. Remember the picture I show you, we are very happy and pleased with the situation that we have multi-asset class, fixed income and equity products, basically bending themselves out. So through the cycle, and we have seen that even in bad times, we can deliver what the clients like. So that may be from the summary. And if I may, we would go for questions.</p><p>I would take the first one, Marko, because that's fair because you have to get through the -- towards -- to the list, and then I'm very happy to give you some of the most difficult ones. And then I take the easy ones again.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>AXEL JUERGEN SCHWARZER: So just for -- should I read questions or can I just -- I read the questions. So Daniel Regli from Octavian ask me on Page 48, about the margins, no surprise. Fee margins and equities and multi-assets seem to have been more under pressure than fixed income. What were the key drivers for this? Product mix within the asset classes, for example, he suggests. What are your expectation regarding fees margin going forward?</p><p>That's a good question. I have to say. Let me go through the -- to the 3 different asset classes. I wouldn't say that when you look at the average, 60.5%, that our equity margins are under pressure. But what we have done deliberately, we have a very small portion of performance fees, particular in multi-asset class and in equity to a certain degree. This is a little bit the performance fee effect, but more so when you look in the -- that's a little technical answer, but I think it's fair to say that transparently. Funds are measured by TER, the total expense ratio and usually, you have a service fee. And what we have done to be more competitive with the market, we have reduced the service fee internally, not pressure from the market, to give more of our products to the market. So that's the effect on the equity side.</p><p>Multi-asset is very clearly the performance fee effect on one hand, which we haven't really collected in 2020, no surprise here. And of course, that we focus rather more, what we said on the previous page on active beta, and active beta is our replacement game for the passive business. And for sure, there are areas where the margins are not that high. But in general, I would say yes, we have here, because of the performance fee, a little more volatility. But in general, we still can collect in the multi-asset class institutional business, which that is the majority of our book of business, a fairly high margin. And I think you didn't answer about fixed income because here, the margins are very decent.</p><p>How do I see the margin going forward? I think they will stay and should stay definitely over 40. That's our minimum ambition. And depending on the markets go, there will definitely not decrease how we see that because there are still, as we try to allude to, there is an appetite, and they're so willing to pay a quality price for high-quality product. So I'm rather worried about the quality of the products, which we have to deliver every time 24/7 rather than in our area where we play a huge portion of fee margin, which you can see, for example, from the fixed income piece.</p><p>With that, I would love to hand over to Marko to questions from Nicholas Herman, who is very busy with a lot of questions here. Marko, you want to take the next one, please?</p><p>MARKO RODER: Yes, sure. Thanks, Nicholas, for a question on ESG. Look, our ESG journey is 26 years old. This is partially a route in cooperations we had already in the '90s, building out ESG competence. It's also very consistent with the values of our main owner. So we have different ways of expressing ESG. One is our values, our adherence to UNPRI principles, but I think the most important direct impact in portfolio is construction of ESG into our portfolios. So we offer solutions that I think are unique. Look at our mtx sustainable equity offering. It's a deep integration, so the ESG is part of constructing the portfolio. It's also one of our most growing areas, sustainable emerging market equity. So we're innovating here, right? We're adhering to culture values and principles, but you have to innovate in how you bring it into the portfolio. So that's one leg of answering your question here.</p><p>You named the best ESG manager. What's the competitive advantage? So it's more than 2 decades of experience. It's a very strong culture supporting us, but in particular, scale and constructing ESG into portfolios, in multi-asset, in fixed income and in equities.</p><p>Then the next question relating to ESG is you asked about the green classification system and the EU-triggered reporting. We have a specialist team for that. So we make sure that we are always a step ahead of the regulatory requirements. That's something that makes sense to us. What we feel, as I said it earlier, it will be a standard to portfolio implementation, reporting, communication, like risk management is nowaday, right? You wouldn't run portfolios without professional risk management. So you're right here, that is a big trend. It's not a differentiator in our view, it's something you have to do, and you have to do it right.</p><p>Then how do you expect that to affect the industry overall? Does it drive extra cost for you because of differences in your own ESG system? Not really. It's not like we're discovering ESG investing. We have long track records there. We really think about improving our reporting, and we're working a lot with our portfolio managers to really make it extend the part of every client communication. It's not like we have to build extra capability, we just apply them more consistently.</p><p>And then your final question on ESG, what is the asset mix here? So really, I mean, think about the ESG inclusion to cover, at some stage, all assets. And so at the moment, I'd say 50% of the assets are already fully involved in ESG portfolio construction. It goes across literally most of our high-growth products. So we have sustainable, specifically sustainable products, but we're also improving our overall ESG awareness in all products.</p><p>AXEL JUERGEN SCHWARZER: I'll take this one. All right then. Thank you, Marko, for the ESG insights. I will take the next round, Daniel. It's you again, Page 50. I don't love that question, I have to say, because I worked in the U.S. Isn't North America also the most advanced and most competitive market? There's a question mark, that's a good thing. Do you think you can succeed in this market as relatively small player? What's your USP? We can question whether this is -- it's the biggest market, but what's the most competitive market if you have very good products, you can be in that market. And honestly, we are already very successful. In the U.S. market, one of the few foreign asset managers because we have one of our boutiques, quality growth, based in New York and in Fort Lauderdale, which this year, as Marko alluded to, is over CHF 30 billion of assets, is already very successful in the U.S.</p><p>So we know how that works, we know how the market works, we know how distribution works. We have partners, we have the products. And we thought if we can do it with one product, we should do -- we should be able to do with more products. So what we're going to do is on the base, together with our partners and our own distribution, we will introduce, which we already have, products from TwentyFour into the U.S. market and then products from Zurich into the U.S. market, for example, emerging market bond. And believe it or not, the quality of emerging market bond products in U.S. is -- or let's say, the numbers high, the quality is definitely an area where we can attack. And so we feel if we do things right and we have a lot of equities, great talents in the U.S. that we can enter this very big market and make this market even more so to one of our growth journeys, which we really enjoy doing.</p><p>So yes -- and our USPs, and like we like and Swiss, and you know I'm part of the Swiss Asset Management Federation (sic) [Swiss Funds &amp; Asset Management Association,] so as we like analyst asset managers in Switzerland, American clients like to have a different view about the world than just from a U.S. manager, and they're very open to have an international successful manager as part of their portfolio as well. So I think we're equipped fairly well to enter this market. It will be, hopefully, a great journey we can share and discuss going forward. So then the next question is from Nicholas again. Marko, you want to take that?</p><p>MARKO RODER: Yes. Sure, yes. Thank you, Nicholas. Good question there. So I assume you think about the management fee, right, so that's if you were collecting on separate accounts or commingled funds or any advisory situations we have with the client. Look, we don't sell cheap. We design our products to deliver the alpha, the yield, the beta we mentioned earlier. So our desire is to ask for price. We have investment capacity that is not unlimited. We have enough, right, but we will ask for the price that brings us to a fair compensation.</p><p>Now if you want to compare it, of course, you have to bring in a bit the volume of the business. For a larger client, say, a large separate account, you will have a lower management fee. But there, I'd refer to the slide Axel showed earlier, you will see us pretty stable there. What we would reject is low-fee business, right? High-quality alpha, yield, beta, you don't throw it away for a low price. We have time, we have no rush to grow. We want to grow at a good price and for good guidelines.</p><p>And then, I guess, Nicholas, that plays into your second question on active beta and the margin. So look, you see the average margin in multi-asset. That is largely driven by active beta. Now active beta has -- we have different ways of playing that. We have an active beta fund, and you can look it up, it has a very good price, a typically commingled fund price in the multi-asset space. This is a highly active -- high-active risk fund. So it's not an index something. We ask for a fair price, and we've had beautiful growth in that fund.</p><p>We're also offering institutional separate accounts with the active beta strategy. And there, it really depends on the size of the engagement. We've had, this year, 2 very large engagements so that will bring the price per unit down somewhat but still be a very attractive outcome for both the client and us. So in that sense, if you see any fluctuation in the active beta pricing, it's a function of the size of the client funding we have received.</p><p>AXEL JUERGEN SCHWARZER: Thank you, Marko. Let me take the next one. You get the other one, which you'd like to enjoy. The next one is from M\u00c3\u00a1t\u00e9 Nemes from UBS. Growth -- I know it's more your turf, but I'd love to answer that one. Growth strategy in the U.S. and the APAC seems to be a large extent depend on the success of your global bank initiatives. How do you make sure your products get the necessary bandwidth from these highly-sought-after intermediaries. As you are one of our global bank targets as well, I really love that question. You're absolutely right. What the consultants are for the institutional business are, at the end of the day, going forward, the global banks for the fund business.</p><p>And as Marko has -- it's, of course, the product quality, but a lot of people have product quality. That's the thing. But what Marko showed you this one slide, how we engage with global banks changes not our thinking about the clients, changes the entire thinking about how we want to act as an investment firm going forward. Because as we said before, and I'm sure Zeno alluded to, if you don't want to be a bank, you need much more investment expertise across all the value chains you have from compliance, onboarding, legal operation. So -- and not every firm, even bigger ones, are organized as Marko says, with A teams so that we can deliver across the value chain from fund selection, operation, share classes, support on the ground, the entire value chain. And when you would see, we call it our heat map, when we started this journey with the global banks, it was almost red. We came from Switzerland, and we didn't work with global banks. In the meantime, not everything is green, but most of it is green, and I think the global banks appreciate very much that we cover the entire, if you will, touch point and change of these bank.</p><p>This gives us, if we understand how global banks work, and not every global bank is the same, so Citibank might be different than UBS or others or JPMorgan or Morgan Stanley or whoever -- they're different in their way. And you have -- like a detective, you have to see where their hotspots, end points are, what they need and if you can deliver and we have an own unit to covering those global banks. And if you are diligent in delivering what they need, I would define this as the bandwidth we need to play. And of course, performance and product quality matters, but it's more than that. And if you have that, you have the attention of a global bank. Because not every -- even much bigger organization are not that organized outside in and can deliver high-quality service or operation across the value chains, the individual banks want.</p><p>I hope that answers your question. And the next one, I give it to Marko because it starts with a nicer question so...</p><p>MARKO RODER: A nicer question. Thank you, Nicholas. It's a good question, too, by the way. So let me just read it out. From a distribution perspective and client dialogue, flows have been pretty stellar over the past 1.5 years. You've always had the performance. Is it just demand? Or has something else changed from a distribution perspective?</p><p>So look, I'd say, Nicholas, look at the numbers, right? I mean you see them very clearly. The flows have been strong for a bit longer than 1.5 years, right? We had some outflows in 2016 from quality growth equities that direct into the next 2 years. But you look at the inflows, the gross flows, right, we've been strong in fixed income for a bit longer. It's quite important, right, because you want to look at when we incepted products, look at mtx, really 10-year track record now, building it up, our credit franchise, TwentyFour, right, these are 10, sometimes 8 years journey, and then we get them into the money. Of course, you have to perform, right? But you don't always have to perform. It's quite important, right, when the market goes into a junk rally, you don't want to perform, right, not as a high conviction, but of an active manager.</p><p>So we've had performance, but we've also had times without performance. The key thing is we have very long track records, and we take time to show them to the clients. So the flows have been pretty stable, but you compare it now to exactly 10 years ago, exactly 10 years ago, we were a one-trick pony, amazing flows in equities only, and we didn't like that, right? So over that decade, we diversified the flow. So what we're harvesting now doesn't come overnight. It also doesn't come in 1.5 years. It's been built up with long-standing track records, binding these PMs, right? The narrative of the slide deck here is exactly that. You bind these PMs, and you take the time to get them to perform.</p><p>And when they underperform, you want to explain it to your clients, right? You want you to stand by your clients and explain underperformance and build trust them. So to answer your question, of course, you need to perform against your guidance and against your performance promise. And of course, the good performance and the great product line have helped us to build out distribution. So your question is hinting at the right point, right? It's building out the regions, it's building out the channels. That's the global banks journey we mentioned earlier, right? So we couldn't have the diversity from a client and regional perspective without the amazing product diversity that Axel showed earlier, yes? So I hope that answers your question, and perhaps I take the one from Daniel.</p><p>AXEL JUERGEN SCHWARZER: And I agree with...</p><p>MARKO RODER: Yes. Daniel said it's for me so I wouldn't -- here we go. A bit of similar sort of saying, well, great net new money, but how sustainable do you consider this growth pace to be? And how far can you -- and you say it's to influence the net new money? Or is it more a result of investment performance and market sentiment?</p><p>Look, I think I answered quite a bit of that. Perhaps Nicholas and you said it in the same room, perhaps not, right, but I think it's kind of the same story, right? You need both. You need amazing product, but you also need the reach to the client. Now the one very simple rule I can give you here is to make the amount of flows we have, with that diversity, you need 2 things in place: appetite for the asset class and appetite for our product. If one is missing, you don't make billions. And we have the time to wait for these magic moments. And when they're there, we engage with our clients, and we have joint success with them. So it is repeatable. Can we imagine a scenario where we could struggle with the flow? That could always happen. But you look at the last years, we've designed products such that in different market environments, we could always engage with the clients. Yes, so I hope that answered your question there, Daniel. Thank you.</p><p>AXEL JUERGEN SCHWARZER: Thank you very much. I think I'd take -- it looks like it's the last one, from [Kendall,] not want to be unpolite, it's just [Kendall] from [Sunset Capital], who asked the question, how has the new One Vontobel strategy change the ways you managed the division, manage products, distribute products or approach clients. Let me say, in the first place, I think the One Vontobel journey to become investment was great. It's a wonderful opportunity for me as an asset manager, and I have 2 heads and the investment head. From the Asset Management perspective, nothing really has changed because the client unit is still the same, and we're doing the same thing.</p><p>However, where I see the beauty going forward for us to grow is on the investment side because what we have combined is -- and there, of course, we manage products and what we call internally the client meet the product marketplace in a little different way. I'm talking about the relationship between Asset Management, the Wealth Management unit and the investment hub which is, if you will, the center of excellence for all the investment products. So what we have seen here is that we can find a lot of synergies and great products in other parts of the organization where earlier haven't looked at. I give you the example. So of course, when you have Asset Management, Wealth Management, you are silos, it's supposed to be like that. I don't mind having silos if that's the business model, why not, if people focus.</p><p>On the other hand, if you break the silos, you have to have a different management style. So -- and what we have seen is a give and take when you bring those people together. So what we found is, in the area of Wealth Management, a really great product. I think I mentioned that already in one of the pages, the so-called megatrend fund, which was only for Wealth Management so far. So what Marko then has discovered, and we said, well, this is a great fund for all of us. So -- and we tore the walls down. We will make that fund available for other fund distributors. So I think we're working much more together. The collaboration on the investment team side is better. So the injection we can give to the Wealth Management people is -- because I personally have very high standards on product quality, we can upgrade, and that's unique for a house, which combines Wealth Management and Asset Management, our investment processes and the Wealth Management to a margin of the institutional standards to the benefit of the Wealth Management client. Be it affluent or be it ultra-high net worth, it doesn't really matter because the product comes in different shapes and forms. So this is something where we have to work together.</p><p>I mean Marko alluded to, we can learn on how do we serve the client by using Salesforce. Are there common clients we can basically penetrate together? Yes, we can, some not.</p><p>So I think there's a lot of potential. That's what I want to say, and opportunities, vice versa, to bring it together. Another example, the borders are open, if you will. We have a little trend team in Asset Management. And we thought, well, the investment guys from Wealth Management are better in that. So we moved the portfolio manager, who run those products under Asset Management hat in the old days over and are much more powerful and ready to attack in a very interesting theme and trend-based product side and asset classes, which we feel is one of the future trends going forward and bring them to the market. So I am a big supporter of the way going forward, and it could make a lot of sense here, but we are just beginning. Yes, we are just beginning. But if you ask my management style, does it change? Not really. That's not the case.</p><p>So let me see whether we have another question.</p><p>MARKO RODER: One more from Nicholas, shall I take that?</p><p>AXEL JUERGEN SCHWARZER: Yes, please.</p><p>MARKO RODER: Yes. Nicholas, a good point actually. I answered your question there on the margin for active beta but didn't see the second part, which is what is the edge in the active beta strategy. Now this is a really good question, right, because active beta is really us addressing high risk or high sort of active risk beta returns. So look, the way this has been built is it had a 20-year journey with us. You really incepted the strategy with German pension plans with great academic background. So very long track record in building the algorithms, but also improving the strategy right with very demanding clients. The largest institutional asset base are Germany clients, but they are some of the best names you can imagine. So the strategy is validated by really strong client demand.</p><p>Now what clients like about it, it is a white box. It is very transparent. You can see the active risk, you can even coauthor the risk budget with us. But you see exactly the factor by [NCC] to contribution, so very transparent, long data track records, right, so we can analyze every market situation, and the strategy is throwing out very consistent outcomes, yes? So very robust, very repeatable, extremely transparent, co-validated by some of the best pension plans in Europe. It makes an amazing story. And it even gives you content, right, so that we -- just beyond performance, but we can really build up a great content narrative from a systematic strategy here that's run with algorithms. So that's the -- it's amazing. I recommend you invest in it, the active beta fund.</p><p>And then you have another totally different question on how we do the billing with our clients, whether we charge it monthly or quarterly. This is not that easy to answer because it depends a bit on the contractual situation. We have different payment models there. But then I'd say you want to separate between institutions and commingled fund clients, but there's no one -- not one generic answer, unfortunately, for you on your technical question here, Nicholas.</p><p>AXEL JUERGEN SCHWARZER: Well, then I think we are done. Thank you very much for your question. We enjoyed to answer them. If there are more, then send us an e-mail, and we are happy to answer them. And I can't see you, that's a little bit unused for us. Thank you for your attention and interest in Asset Management of Vontobel. Thank you.</p><p>MARKO RODER: Thank you.</p><p>&lt;Presentation&gt;</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER, HEAD OF WEALTH MANAGEMENT &amp; MEMBER OF THE EXECUTIVE BOARD, VONTOBEL HOLDING AG: A very warm welcome from my side. My name is Georg Schubiger. I am heading the Wealth Management business here at Vontobel. Let me start with talking a little bit about growth of the past year, as you see on this slide, we have the compound annual growth rate of 15% during the last 5 years, which is very strong also compared to the industry. As you know, that is a combination between acquisitions. There were 5 smaller and larger acquisitions that we had during that year, but also strong net new money figures or organic growth. As you can see on the right side, also those growth figures have gone down post the acquisition, which has, of course, to do with the integration efforts that we had.</p><p>And I guess, in the first half of '22, we were, as all other players, also exposed to the entire COVID restrictions that made traveling difficult and made us focus on the clients that we had.</p><p>If you look at our revenues, I think we are very proud of being able to increase and defend our return on assets.</p><p>Also post acquisition, we have a very stable business in that sense. And if you look at the right side, the earnings composition is very healthy. It's also -- we have been managing a transition where, today, we have even more recurring fees, and we have further reduced the transaction-based fees. And also that, of course, with all the integration targets that we -- before the targets that we have integrated.</p><p>How does our book look like? We have over 50% of the assets that are domiciled in Switzerland and another 42% that are in our focus markets, and 7% are others. What does that mean? It's a very, very stable business, very much focused on the areas where we have decided to play and where we have decided to compete.</p><p>How do we create organic growth? One of the main drivers of organic growth is hiring new relationship managers, expanding the business, building the business up. You see here the figures during the last couple of years.</p><p>With the acquisitions, we acquired 81 new relationship managers and of course, I've already told you, we had an integration process. We had also some restructuring built in there. So the total figure actually stagnated, but that's a combination of hiring and also letting people go.</p><p>And we are now at roughly 271, and you can expect that we will continue that strategy. We have been very successful in attracting talents. We have also been very successful in managing their business cases. We have high rates here. And one of the main reason is that people believe we're stable, we're a very much client-focused organization compared to others and also because we give people a lot of power. We give people a lot of ownership in their engagements with their clients.</p><p>Clients, another very important factor, another area that we're very proud of. Here, you see our client surveys that we conduct very regularly. We had actually conducted one in the very heat of the corona crisis this spring, so we were not afraid where the world was in turmoil to ask our clients what they think of Vontobel. And we were positively, very positively surprised in those who are happy with the result. You see here the Net Promoter Score, which is very high, especially for our industry with 63% promoters. And you see that we have actually the share of clients that are satisfied with wealth management. We even have slightly increased it in the first half of year compared to last year. And that is of course a very, very, strong basis for a healthy business is clients that actually promote us and clients that are satisfied with the way we operate.</p><p>It's a wealth management private banking and especially in Switzerland, it's a industry that has done through many transitions. This is an industry where a lot of a disruptive effects happens. And let me spend a few minutes talking about what we have done in some of these areas and how we positon us also going forward.</p><p>When we talk about the value proposition, and it has been mentioned before, we have worked a lot about the brand, the brand Vontobel and how we position wealth management. And what is also at the core of our positioning is actually our investment offering. We have created, and I'll explain that quickly later, a 3a proprietary investment philosophy, which all our solutions are based on.</p><p>We have introduced, at the same time, a very holistic advisory process, not a process where we advise or suggest the product, but we actually go quite broadly through the clients' demands and needs. And based on that and the solutions that come out, we have introduced the value-based pricing which is quite special for the industry. I'll get to that later.</p><p>We've worked on the service model. We have, since one of the things of our growth strategies is hire talents. We have invested a lot into the quality of those talents that has to do on the one side with education, but also on the other side also with technical tools to increase their efficiency.</p><p>We believe that we have one of the best relationship manager advisory tools that exists in Switzerland. At the same time, we have invested in digital interaction, digital channels.</p><p>On the growth drivers, as I said, attracting talent is the topic that also goes going forward. But also a lot of investments into digital interaction, into AI, into personalized services, but still digital and I know that my colleague, Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois R\u00c3\u00bcf has already talked about that topic intensely before me.</p><p>Let's look at the advisory process. I do that very short, but it is, for us, very important that we understand the entire landscape of the clients' needs. So starting, obviously before most people do, understanding the situation but also dynamically the goals and the plans, where do you want to get, what do you want to be able to afford, what's the family situation, et cetera. And from that, derive a strategy and a focus where we should deliver. That leads us to a solution, a solution and investment solution. As I said, that is based on the 3a concept.</p><p>What is it? It's actually a registered trade mark, but what is it? We say the first alpha is a broad diversification of assets, a robust diversification is the fundamental of every investment is something we believe everybody should have. The second alpha is all around convictions. It's account convictions for industry trends, it can be economic changes. In macros, it can be megatrends as the block time -- blockchain technology. And the third alpha is opportunities, market opportunities that we believe exist because we believe a share or a bond or an asset class is underweighted.</p><p>We have transformed almost the entire customer base into that framework, and it has really helped us to differentiate in the market. You might know in most competitors, you go in and they have 3 different mandate types. They have a balance, they defend it and the growth in 3 currencies means 9 offerings. We have a very different set up. And it works when you discuss with the client. It works a little bit like when you buy a car. You buy a car and you're not done there. The car is our first alpha, and everybody likes it. And then we have the discussion about the second. And you say, \"Well, so you are not interested in participating in some of the industry strengths, our convictions?\" That's like with the car when the question comes about the security system or about some luxurious seats.</p><p>Most clients say, \"Well, yes. Well, actually, I would like to be part of that.\" And so you go through that discussion. And at the end, partly also to our surprise, a big number of clients actually went for all 3 alphas, which also from a pricing perspective, then is more attractive for us.</p><p>As I said, we talk about solutions and not products, you see that -- see that here. We have, to the left, we have our managed solutions that are the discretionary mandates. We have advisory services. And then we have digital services, and we have something that's called Vontobel Compose. What does that mean?</p><p>It's a combination thereof. A client is not just an advisory client or a discretionary client. Clients have different needs in their solutions. They use different products together. We price them differently according to where we believe we create value. And in that sense, we have -- we believe that we have created quite a differentiating offering, a value-based priced offering and something that is very attractive to our clients.</p><p>And that is one of the reason why we had such a strong ROA development compared to the industry because that really helped us explain to clients why they should pay for our services. Where does it go from here? You see above, as I said, the advisory process the 3a Philosophy and the modular pricing, we believe we can do much more. We can build on that. We started this 2 years ago.</p><p>So a lot of thinking at the moment goes around an improved sales engine. So that's the engine that brings the investment contents to our clients. Investment contents, we have actually a lot, as you have been hearing from our colleagues from asset management investments before. That means also replacing an end-of-cycle CRM system into a CRM system that is very well known. I think we will be one of the first, if not the first, to do that in Switzerland. It also means much more digitalized and structured pipeline management, sales management. I think there's a lot we can do in addition than what we do here.</p><p>On the right side, in my mind, very interesting prospect here is the whole digital lead generation, digital project generation, digital outflow prevention. I think Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois R\u00c3\u00bcf has talked a little bit about that. We need to strengthen the relationship managers with leads that come from other areas than their natural network. Only like that, we will be able, over time, to increase our growth rate.</p><p>And I think there's a lot of very interesting things that can be done here. And a lot of interesting things that haven't been thought in that way over in the financial services industry. Wealth planning. The third one, it's a service that we have bought, a capability that we have bought with Notenstein La Roche and that we are strengthening and increasing all the time.</p><p>And it's also a little bit in addition to what relationship managers usually produce. The last point -- and that's almost a reason for existence. I think we cannot rest. We can never rest to work on our client experience, client satisfactions on the journeys. I think the financial industry in general is not at the forefront of doing this. And in our case, we have quite high ambitions in order to improve that. Be it starting from client onboarding from the entire servicing, but day-to-day managing and reporting.</p><p>Let me make a few examples to that. Client onboarding. In many cases, I think you all know the stories of clients that try to become client of an institution and then are burdened with paper and paper and paper and paper, almost impossible to understand. We have created a digital application that everybody can download where you become digitally a client. Looks like that. Client onboarding has been very important also during corona time.</p><p>Obviously, that's for simple cases for clients that have private assets. But nevertheless, it was very important for us as an organization to learn how you can do that digitally, to learn how you can do that remotely. And it's something that we will use much more in the future. So we have done a combination. We have not just taken a current process and digitalized it.</p><p>No, we have actually made the onboarding process significantly simpler and then put it on a digital tool. I mentioned before our relationship manager tool to do advisory. It's one of our biggest technical investments that we have done in wealth management in the past. And so what is it? And why have we done it? Well, with the increasing number of regulations, MiFID is one of them, with the increasing number of restrictions and conditions in order to advise clients, we have basically concluded we need to help the relationship manager to do this in a much more automated way.</p><p>So just let me explain this with guiding you through some slides. So here, you see a holistic view of a client's portfolio. Holistic, I mean all the assets that clients have with us. He might have a discretionary mandate. He might have some cash somewhere. He might have an advisory mandate. It's all together. It can be -- it's real-time at any second, the adviser sees what's in that portfolio. At any second, it calculates all important parameters. You see here, market risk and counterparty risk. And with that, the client relationship manager, immediately when he gets into contact with the client, has all the relevant information.</p><p>Okay. That's nice, but there is more to that. So you have an advisory discussion and now you figure out you enter in a discussion or you suggest now for the purpose of this example now, you suggest let's see what happens to my portfolio if I buy Intel shares. So the client adviser can choose that. And then the machine calculates in milliseconds, all relevant parameters that you have to have in advisory. So that's portfolio risk. It calculates historic scenarios, how would that portfolio develop in case of another Lehman situation, counterparty exposure, FIDLEG, MiFID requirements, regulatory documents. It immediately creates all the documents that has to be sent to the client in order to do that trade.</p><p>It checks all cross-border rules. Is that -- Intel now isn't easy. But for example, in a mutual fund, is it actually registered in that country, tax rule, distribution restrictions. And even an ESG rating, I have to say, only as of spring next year, but that's also in that machine. So in a millisecond, this is calculated for over half a million of securities and financial instruments. And that makes work of the relationship manager, very powerful and very efficient.</p><p>He can just do that for a number of securities. He can make a whole proposal how to restructure the portfolio with one click, he will send all the pre-trade information to the client and execute all the trade. So it's a way of getting to the point very fast of simplifying the entire process and be fully compliant with all the regulation we are in. And just imagine if the relationship manager had to do all that manually. A trade will take him 2 to 3 days, and the possibility that somewhere is a mistake is actually quite high. So we believe there is a lot of potential in this going in the future because whatever comes new, we can integrate, and we have a very efficient way to do advisory.</p><p>Before I conclude, let me talk quickly about one more initiative that we have mentioned at the year-end where we want to strengthen our efforts. And that is ultra-high net worth individual clients. Ultra-high net worth individual clients for us is a potential growth area for a number of reasons. But for the most important reason that we believe we have a lot of things to offer. You see that on that one side. Obviously, we have the entire investment universe, which we believe is differentiating as such.</p><p>Then we have a corporate finance unit or capital advisory unit, very specifically in our side, only on our case, only buy side. We're only on the side of the investors. We have a number of exclusive offerings that we can give, for example, being the leading Swiss equity researcher. It's very powerful that the clients can actually meet the person that has covered the share for the last 10 years and had the best ratings ever. And finally, debt financing, not just taking loans on our book, but with customer funding, actually helping clients to arrange loans that other players take on that book.</p><p>And I know with that, my time is over, I would like to thank you very much. I would like to use the opportunity to show you a QR code. If you would like to test one or the other of our digital applications, please read it in, and thank you very much.</p><p>And now I would like to introduce my colleague, Markus Pfister, who will talk about an efficient capital markets machine.</p><p>MARKUS PFISTER, HEAD OF STRUCTURED PRODUCTS, VONTOBEL HOLDING AG: Thank you very much, Georg, and welcome to my presentation about our efficient capital markets machine. Structured products was merged earlier this year with credit structuring and treasury to provide all risk transformation products from one source. Our center of excellence called Structured Solutions &amp; Treasury offers, therefore, not only structured products, but also Lombard loans, mortgages and manages the treasury of whole Vontobel. On the left side of your presentation, you can see how advised clients are serviced. A large number of external asset managers and banks are served by our client unit, Platforms &amp; Services. In addition, private clients are served by relationship managers in our client unit, Wealth Management.</p><p>The products are usually created and executed through our multi-issuer platform, deritrade, or on a bespoke solutions basis. On the right-hand side, it can be seen clearly that we have also a large number of self-directed clients in the client unit, Digital Investing. These clients generally use our products and services from their principal bank via stock exchange or broker.</p><p>This is mainly reflected in market share in these channels. These customers usually use our derinet for information. All these client units use our products and services for risk transformation. The breakdown for the first half 2020 demonstrates that most of the revenues are from Digital Investing. We are among the top 10 banks in the trading of structured products on digital channels with a long and strong track record in all major European countries.</p><p>We are the biggest issuer in Switzerland and one of the biggest in Europe. Last but not least, we have a wide range of products and are well-known for our quality regarding products, market making and client service. Since a few years, we also established our brand for actively managed certificates, where we already won an award this year for the best sustainable AMC. In this product category, we see increasing market demand for thematic investments in general.</p><p>We are convinced and have already proven at various points that technology can do more than just automate manual work steps. On the client side, we will be able to deliver a better experience for customers by providing them with premium content they need to make decisions. Focus is on understanding the needs and pain points of our current and future users.</p><p>Technologically, we are very lean and agile. We have one global platform and a global risk book. Already today, we provide our customers, services and products 20 hours a day. We will offer our risk managers more tools, such as automated fitting algos, which simplified their lives in such a way that they are able to cover a massively bigger number of products per person. This makes the business more scalable.</p><p>And finally, we also use machine learning components to make the hedging of position more efficient, especially in the low latency trading environment, as Fran\u00c3\u00a7ois R\u00c3\u00bcf explained before. Our integrated architecture ensures that all content, be it recommendations, ideas, products is available at the point of sale. The product finds the customer, not vice versa.</p><p>In addition, the high-quality systems of structured products serve as the basis for the recently integrated lending business and treasury. We see ourselves clearly not only supported by technology but rather driven by technology. Our overall goal is to lighten the balance sheet, while at the same time, increasing the business. The merger of structured products with treasury and credit structuring is an important part in this undertaking as all risk transformation products will come from one source.</p><p>This has the advantage that risks are equally priced, and we prevent arbitrage on the balance sheet. In the case of structured products, we aim to continue to establish a wide labeling offering for third-party issuers. The ambition is to go live with Banque Cantonale Vaudoise by the end of this year as soon as the testing phase is finished.</p><p>But we are also strengthening our internal marketplace for option prices to achieve the most competitive hedging prices for structured products. Besides internal hedging, about 1/4 of option risks are already directly passed on to third parties. This leads to a risk balancing between our own books and the transfer to counterparties.</p><p>All treasury functions are now combined, and the trading book and banking book are managed from a single unit. This leads to improved diversification across counterparties, sectors, countries to achieve a better risk return profile and to improve predictability. Credit structuring now has more instruments at hand. Loans can only be granted to clients as a Lombard loan or mortgage. In the future, also securitized forms such as leveraged products or leveraged actively managed certificates are now also available from the same source.</p><p>In addition, large and capital-intensive transactions can be passed on directly to investors outside of the balance sheet with cosmofunding. As a nice side effect, the technologically advanced system of structured products can also be used in part for the active margin monitoring of loans.</p><p>Overall, all these does not lead to more risk appetite, but to more service at the point of sales, thanks to technological benefits. Therefore, more business with relatively little capital.</p><p>Finally, I would like to highlight a few of our growth initiatives. In the area of actively managed certificates, we will invest to offer best-in-class technology. Already now, we have a very comprehensive offering. We provide cross-asset products and listing in all key markets. In addition, we will gain speed with digital onboarding and fast issuance processes. And we make life easier for portfolio managers with improved rebalancing tools and rule-based automation by our model portfolios.</p><p>As a further point of risk transformation, we will introduce leveraged AMCs to meet our large customer need. In recent years, we have invested a lot in the back end of our structured product platform. We are now able to supply our customers with products, not only via the multi-issuer platform, deritrade, but we can also integrate our powerful product pricer into the value chain of partners via state-of-the-art interfaces.</p><p>The yellow bars in the middle of your presentation show the volume development via deritrade web page, while the blue part shows the volume, which we sell directly to partner banks via back end interfaces. We not only export solutions from Europe to Asia, but we also develop in Singapore and Hong Kong and offer these features to customers in Europe.</p><p>Thanks to one global platform, we only have to develop each tool and each product feature once and can use it then to all customers in all markets by all channels. On digital channels, we are one of the top 10 banks in trading structured products. We have a long and strong track record in all major European countries and have a high level of customer loyalty. derinet is, by far, the most visited Vontobel web page. Our self-directed clients regularly search there for information, products and prices.</p><p>We will renew the platform technically and visually to create a unique customer journey and user experience that starts already outside of the platform. It will not just be a website for product searches, but we will rather help clients to identify suitable solutions from a One Vontobel perspective, making it easy and intuitive to invest in these solutions.</p><p>So far from my side, now I'm delighted to hand over to our new CFO, Thomas Heinzl.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL, CFO, HEAD OF FINANCE &amp; RISK AND MEMBER OF EXECUTIVE BOARD, VONTOBEL HOLDING AG: Thank you very much. My name is Thomas Heinzl, as mentioned already, I'm the CFO. I'm in force since 1.5 months. It is my first appearance in this function and in this place. And I'm really excited and happy to be here. Would be a little bit nicer if we could meet in person and have chats and have interactions in this room, instead of me talking into a little black box, but we all do the best to get over this and hope the situation will improve soon.</p><p>Now I have the pleasure to introduce a couple of great numbers, which the organization has delivered over the last 3 years. Basically, we're starting in H1 2017. And as you can see, advised client assets growth was around 10%, which is quite spectacular. PBT growth, 8.4%, the same of 27% over a 3 years period. And don't forget, this happened in an environment where the industry is under pressure, we still have increasing regulation and complexity of the business and finally, the markets over that 3 years weren't quite a walk in the park either. I mean we had, of course, March 2020, but don't forget, December '19 -- '18, 2018 where there were a lot of opportunities where one could trip over and fall.</p><p>So the P&amp;L that you can see here, the P&amp;L development is really a result of repositioning of Vontobel towards an investment house and a disciplined execution that goes with it. Now I'm going to take you now through a couple of drivers to show how this execution has taken place.</p><p>First, strong growth in assets. We have grown the assets by CHF 55 billion, the advised client assets, or 33% since the first half year of 2017. So net new money was the strongest driver, explaining roughly 55%. You have heard about asset management. Asset management on their business grew more than 7% on average, with a strong acceleration after 2019. Wealth management has delivered around 2%. The growth has been a little bit more muted since 2010 -- since 2019, since the focus had to be laid on the synergy realization from the Notenstein La Roche integration.</p><p>M&amp;A contributed another CHF 15 billion or 30%, mostly driven by Notenstein La Roche. And finally, the performance. The performance looks a little bit small, but don't forget, first of all, we have a much stronger position than we had in the past in fixed income. And secondly, not all the markets have had such stellar growth numbers, as the S&amp;P, who made 33% over that period of time. And as you have heard earlier, the performance of funds and mandates have been quite strong.</p><p>The second driver is the margins. Margins have been discussed before as well, but we wanted to show you that in comparison to a couple of peers. We have kept or expanded the ROA while the industry is in margin depression -- compression and in ongoing margin compression.</p><p>If you look at Wealth Management on the left-hand side, we have improved our margin by 9%. So the ROA has increased by 9% versus our peer group, which at best has reached 0 or had shrinking margin. Same thing on the Asset Management side. Here, we are slightly negative. But if you adjust for the shift of business mix because we had more fixed income growth in that over the course of that time, the margin has -- would be around 3% as well, so up to the top peers.</p><p>So -- and we have added also the BCG survey on industry margin in 2016 to 2019. That's timing-wise, not quite the same, but it just shows that the minus 6% shrinking of the margin shows how difficult the industry is in general.</p><p>So Vontobel has bucked the trend of declining margins across the industry, mainly due to 3 things: number one, strong products and strong performance; number two, excellent client service and creating new products for clients that client actually need; and thirdly, of course, pricing discipline always plays a role in these things, too.</p><p>Let me come to the third driver, the high share of recurring income. And I will answer the question that Zeno has been asked earlier. That's a little bit less obvious one. The percent of net commission and fee income, we have a much higher share than most of our competitors with 89%.</p><p>Now the -- let me explain the anatomy of how such -- how the development works between the commission income and the trading income, normally, if you see a significant decline like the one we saw in February. What normally happens is the AUMs market is going down, AUMs are going down. We have the market bottom, either it is fast or takes a little bit longer, and then the market is going back up. That would be our revenue line.</p><p>Now trading works a little bit differently. Because clients, in the beginning of the downturn, they trade a lot, they are adjusting their portfolio. They're afraid of further pressures. They hedge their portfolio and so on and so on. So you have a lot of trading activities in the first phase of a decline of a market. But what happened afterwards, if the adjustments are made, the trading normally stops. So client don't trade significant delays.</p><p>Even for our books, I've looked it up earlier. February, March, April, our trading has been 50% higher than what we had on average during that time. Now the question comes, what happens afterwards. So the trading then normally drops to relatively low levels, the AUM is low and clients are in a waiting position. If the market picks up again, we have seen various patterns here. Normally, the clients are not starting to invest immediately. What clients do is depending on what happened, they are more or less afraid of investing, and they have very, very slowly starting trading and trading into that market again.</p><p>And that's the area where we have a much faster pickup. So as a general remark, of course, revenue, a higher share of revenue income, higher share of recurring income goes both ways. If all clients, all our Wealth Management clients would turn into Robin Hood traders tomorrow and day trade day and night, then, of course, we would have less upside than trading income-oriented peers. But on the downside, we have much more resilience after this initial phase that I just described. That allows us to have more stability in planning. If we have less client activity for 6 to 9 months. That doesn't mean we have to choke off long-term investment initiatives. And it allows us to behave less cyclical. That's the big value of having recurring income.</p><p>So after the income side, I would quickly like to talk about the cost. If you look at it on the highest level, you see that we have reduced the cost/income ratio by 1.4 percentage points despite some significant growth, which looks like not a lot of improvement achieved. But if you look into the details, the picture looks very different. We have reduced the cost/income ratio through operational work by 7.3 percentage points over the course of 3 years. 7.3 percentage points reduction of cost income over the course of 3 years. That's quite an achievement.</p><p>A bit less of that is coming from cost discipline on the existing business and a little bit larger chunk is coming from the integration of Notenstein La Roche. What you see as the next block is we had some dilutive effect from Notenstein La Roche. When we bought it, they had a much higher cost/income ratio than we had. But net-net, we have achieved a cost/income ratio improvement from the Notenstein acquisition all included of more than 2.2% already. And that also explains the focus of Wealth Management on making sure that we generate the value and generate the synergies out of this acquisition that we have done.</p><p>The next topic, the 1.5 percentage points is what Zeno explained earlier, it is the increasing investment in IT. I want to make one point here. It says data and analytics, and -- but we're not talking about lofty spend on research labs or stable coin initiatives with a consortia of other banks. What we're talking about here is concrete investments both to improve on the client side and to improve also on the efficiency side. Sales force has been managed. I mean, if you -- once we have sales force rolled out, where we have invested already quite a bit, we have all the clients on one system, all of our clients across Vontobel are then on one system. And having this data integrity, this data consistency, that's the basis of all of the nice things like digitalization, robotics, AI, all the things that people talk about.</p><p>The change in business mix, that's driven by the consequence of the portfolio adjustment that we have discussed earlier. And then you have, in total, 1.3 percentage points of nonoperating items, which include currency and accounting where this is mostly an IAS 19 effect. So it's not cost leakage that we're talking about. We have taken significant amount of costs. And through some of the strategic initiatives that we have taken, we have reinvested our changes in the business mix that are driving the cost-to-income ratio up again.</p><p>The last driver that I want to talk about is risk. Our annual reports always states that we are conservative in risk management, and we are, and I want to show this here. On the market risk side, you see that we have reduced risk-weighted assets roughly by 20% to 25%. The reduction is coming from trading position, former IB business and then the risk reduction after the COVID-related market disruptions. After COVID, we've taken the risk down significantly, and we have not yet gone up to the same level of risk that we had here even in the beginning of 2017.</p><p>On the credit risk side, the risk-weighted assets have increased significantly. This is driven by the total lending volume, which has increased by CHF 2.5 billion with around, again, 1 quarter stemming from Notenstein La Roche. But let me make some remarks on the credit risk side.</p><p>We have very conservative lending and underwriting standards on the credit side. It's been mentioned before. We are also investing and have invested in technology to manage all of our risks as real-time as possible. And of course, where it is sensible. That situation clearly has paid off in March and in April. We had no losses in Lombard. I've talked to a couple of people, and they worked a lot of hours. But the most important thing, the front and the back of the firm work together all the time end-to-end to ensure that we don't have any losses on the Lombard side.</p><p>I can give you another example, loan loss provisions. It says they've increased by CHF 5 million. They did, but CHF 10 million of this CHF 5 million were coming from Notenstein La Roche that we had to take over. So in essence, for the old business, we have reduced our loan loss provisions.</p><p>Last topic here would be operational risk. There's not a lot to say about operational risk. We use the basic indicator approach. It's a percentage of the revenues as we grow the revenues, the risk-weighted assets are going up. However, if I look at the historic losses that we had and compare them to the equity that we hold -- have to hold against it, I would say the equity that we have to hold is quite -- is way too high for what we want to do for the risk that we actually have here.</p><p>Now how does this all come together? What we've shown you here is the return on equity, and we have compared this to a cost of equity to gauge the value creation that we have realized here. Cost of equity, we just took a number, you can take many of them, picture will be the same. What you can see is very important. If you take a longer-term perspective, Vontobel, first of all, has done a turnaround in the first couple of years and now has created significant value since 2014 and has done so at an accelerating pace.</p><p>So every year, we create a little bit more shareholder value by opening up the difference. Also, we have significantly increased the dividend in the same period. And as you have heard all the other speakers, we plan to continue on that path. Now CFO, what would that mean for the CFO? How can I as a CFO or the CFO organization help to translate the strategy that you have heard into value creation for our shareholders? So first of all, I mentioned this briefly already. This capital markets view, be it capital cost, economic profit, economic value added, shareholder value added, all of these measures. We're looking at them, and we will make sure that they're being heard, used in every corner of the organization.</p><p>With the new setup, we can also start optimizing an integrated value driver view front to back. We have a few now of all of the value drivers front to back and how they work. We don't want to be the most accurate in splitting costs and revenues, the world heavyweight champion in cost allocations. What we want to do is we want to contribute to maximize the pie for the whole of the firm. We want this, and we do this by supporting the business in their optimization. We're calculating profitability after capital by client, product, channel and so on.</p><p>If you have the capital charges and everything included, on such measures, it allows you to gain -- to do a lot of optimization, be it in pricing, be it in product design, bidding, CapEx approvals and so on. So the amount of applications that allow us to improve and optimize the business is quite significant.</p><p>We will continue to use analytics to get to the bottom of things. And on that, getting to the bottom of things, we will focus on 3 topics: number one, we want to maintain a disciplined cost management; number two, we want to fight complexity as we grow. We want to make sure that we keep everything as simple as possible as we grow. And the last thing is we want to focus, focus on things that really matter and things that move the needle.</p><p>Of course, and that is also something that has been managed before, we will keep a conservative risk stance. We are not going to open the tap. We will keep a conservative position towards risks. And last, we will hire in the CFO area, diverse and international talent from our top competitors, and we want to be sure that we learn from them. We're not only hiring them, but we are actively learning from them.</p><p>That takes me to the targets. No surprise, we are going to keep the targets. The macro outlook currently is a little bit mixed, to say the least. I mean, we had this drop in March. We had a good recovery afterwards. Currently, it seems that the economy is stalling and is struggling to push further ahead. It doesn't seem to reach escape velocity. And on the other side, so it's difficult to say whether we will see a really benign environment coming. On the other side, monetary and fiscal policymakers stand ready across the globe to intervene as soon as anything happens in terms of bad economic development.</p><p>So we wanted to keep the targets as a sign that we believe in the strategy and also in the resilience of the business model. So that takes me to the end of the financial part. If I may quickly go through -- if I can talk about 5 things that you could take away from all of these data, all of the things that have been discussed, it is the following.</p><p>First, Vontobel has successfully adjusted its business portfolio, and it has done so by consistently driving the levers of client centricity, being investment-led, enabled by technology, empowered by people. Secondly, against the difficult industry backdrop, we have delivered on all of the key drivers, and we have gone through them earlier. As a result, we are increasingly generating value. And with the strategy and the priorities that we have presented to you where they are designed to further keep us on the trajectory and help us grow further. And we see significant growth opportunities. I mean, we've talked about Asia, U.S., global banks. I mean, these are massive profit pools, and we have only started dipping our toes into these pools.</p><p>And we have everything in place that should help us to succeed in that area. We have the track records. We have the right people, we have the right resources, and we are building on proven strength to gain these markets. And finally, the family control will ensure -- did ensure and will ensure a long-term shareholder-friendly stance at Vontobel. Thanks a lot.</p><p>With that, I would ask my colleagues to join for the Q&amp;A.</p><p>Sorry, it will take a little bit of time. We have a little bit of delay. We're working through this.</p><p>Questions and Answers</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: First question is from Daniel Regli. Where do you see -- first of all, where do you see the gross margin composition going medium term? Referring to Page 67. Can you give us a rough breakdown? Do you foresee a cap to the interest income component?</p><p>Similar question. But speaking more generally, Swiss private banking, Georg, that's for you. You have seen gross margin pressures over the years due to various recent regulatory changes. How do you see that develop? Is there a light at the end of the tunnel?</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER: So I'll start with that one. I'm on Page 62 as well. Yes, that's true. Are we have seen the margins decreasing significantly? Not in our case during the past years, and we have been fighting strongly against that, and that was a combination of changing our value proposition, of course, repapering and repricing on a value-based pricing scheme. I can't see into the future, but I would expect that general industry margin to further increase, but I would also expect us with a differentiating offering and with a sales force or a relationship force trimmed on profitability to further be successful on that note.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Thank you. The next question is same one. How price-sensitive are your clients and what are key pushbacks in negotiating on fee margin? Has the correction seen in H1 eventually helped that clients appreciate professional advice again?</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER: Our clients are price-sensitive, obviously. There's competition out there, but I think wealthy clients understand that there is a price for value. They understand that a price has to be paid for a differentiating product. They understand that the price has to be paid for performance, for alpha generation. And I think these discussions so far, we have been able to successfully manage with our clients.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Good. Next question also for you. Why do you think you're better positioned to cater to ultra-high net worth than the large universal banks like U.S. and creditors? They regularly stress the need of an investment bank to serve these clients. What do you think about this argument?</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER: Well, that's obviously a different business that very large competitors do. And you can read it. I think every CEO or a head of ultra of the large clients say that they will have to use their balance sheet even more in order to cater for ultra-high net worth individuals. That is not our plan, as I said, I think we have a specific offering. We have, first of all, a buy-side only offering. We have no conflicts. There's nobody who has no conflicts. That is very important. And secondly, we will focus, of course, on the liquid investments where we have a very strong offering, combined with advisory services, combined with family planning services. And I think we have a lot to give.</p><p>How many players can say that they have a successful family behind the business? And how many can share some of the experience how that is managed? And that's why I think we are very, very relevant player when it comes to people with a large wealth, when it comes to people that own companies. Not sure the large competitors can do that.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Good. Next question, also to you, Georg. Do you have new markets in the pipeline for digital investing or these market entrants entries are not in focus for the market? That's from -- a question from UBS.</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: I take that over on behalf of Toby Triebel, who will be with us as of October phase, but I have been in charge for digital so far. So as within digital -- public distribution is the bedrock or the starting point to the business. And there, we have already market presences across Europe. So it's Switzerland. And then within Europe, it's Germany, Italy, Benelux, France, the Scandinavian countries, and it's a footprint in Hong Kong.</p><p>So the first mandate is to deepen the penetration of these markets and to broaden the offering to the clients starting from public distribution and building from that strength towards a more holistic digital offering. And we think deepening and scaling market presences comes first before we think about entering other markets.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Okay. Next one is on Wealth Management again from Nicholas Herman from Citi. You talk about high client satisfaction, very strong platform. The growth has lagged. How are you going to reignite growth, especially given limits of prospecting new clients and hiring?</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER: Yes. Thank you. I think, as I said in the beginning, growth has lagged also due to our integration efforts of the acquisition. I think, as I pointed it out, we have -- first of all, we have proven in the past, and we will also prove in the future that we are very successful in our growth based on hiring relationship managers and talents in the market, but we don't believe that, that is enough. We don't believe that, that is enough for the future. And that's why I said, we have invested or we invest a lot in the entire area of creating digital leads, creating prospects and feeding that flow into the relationship managers' pipeline.</p><p>And secondly, also on a general sales management perspective, we're at the moment revamping the whole approach, which is, of course, partly, again, technology-driven, but also partly driven by culture. Culture changes.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Next one is also for you, Georg. What are you seeing in terms of activity in Hong Kong? Are you seeing market -- wealth management market share move as the Asian clients move assets outside Hong Kong and China? Have Vontobel and Swiss peers benefited?</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER: Okay. Well, I think activities in Hong Kong, as you know, we have a very small shop in Hong Kong from the Wealth Management side, catering for 9 clients. It's a very specific offering that is just based on our Swiss discretionary and advisory mandates. So we are not in the main business that is being done in Hong Kong that is very much trading based, very much leverage based. And in that sense, we haven't seen large inflows also because, I guess, our offering doesn't correspond then -- doesn't correspond to the offering that the large flows that have been happening actually would require.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Then one question, I think for Zeno. We're seeing launches of digital private banks such as Alpian earlier this year. Do you see these digital private banks moving up the value spec -- up the value spectrum into lower high net worth? Or do you see that as unlikely?</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: Yes, you know if you would have asked us 5 years ago, we would probably have more been on the side unlikely. Today, we would say that also high net worth clients will increasingly ask for digital touch points. So that was one of the reasons also why under the leadership of Georg and his drive, we have heavily increased investments into digital platforms, digital touch points on the Wealth Management side where we are pretty sure and you see that also in other markets, the dominating model will remain hybrid.</p><p>So we will never see complex clients, demanding clients, people who have well-structured across generations completely move away from human interfaces, human advice. That, we do not expect that. But even in their client journey, the digital part will become more important. But on the other side, you have also to face the fact that, obviously, due to the efficiency pressures the overall industry has, due to the margin pressure the overall industry has, actually, service levels for a significant part of the client groups is actually going down. I'm talking about the industry. I'm not talking about Vontobel.</p><p>So there is actually a huge opportunity to bring service back to them through digital channels, digital touch points and data-driven intelligence in order to help them. So I think, yes, we will see digital models, perhaps still with a hybrid kernel to it, take over ever larger parts of client segments. As from the other side, the classic channels are moving to ever larger client groups. So -- and we see this not as a threat. So within our existing and sweet spot client ranges, we see this as an opportunity to bring tech to the table.</p><p>And so these client groups that are kind of left in the shade, we see this as an opportunity to our client unit digital investing.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Good. One more for you, Georg. You consider partnerships globally as a way to grow in wealth management. Is this a strategy that peers of yours have employed to accelerate growth in some of the focus markets?</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER: Yes, we have some partnerships, one that is public, for example, with Lombard Odier, where we have a partnership on the U.S. clients. I think we do that in specific areas. But in general, we have the ambition to be able to grow organically on our own with our product suite.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Good. Next question is coming from UBS, M\u00c3\u00a1t\u00e9 Nemes. Investments into technology are necessary and seem to be one of the key levers of Vontobel's Lighthouse strategy. No surprise though, they also increased the cost-to-income ratio. However, digital onboarding, mass sales force, et cetera, should over time free up time and resources, especially in the middle and back office. When is this going to be visible in the cost base? Can you quantify the expected impact? Yes? Do you want to...</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER: We stick to the cost/income ratio target.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: And I can add that we are measuring this very, very succinctly. So we know everything that is going on and when the benefits are accruing. Good. Next question, Nicholas Herman from Citi. Can we explain on the chart on Page 93? If you think about the path from 74.7 to lower than 72, how would you explain the movement through revenue growth, business mix change, efficiency, et cetera, et cetera?</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: Yes. I mean we get this question very regularly. I would say business mix change should -- probably, we have seen more business mix change over the last 3 years that we're going to see going forward because we now have such a big and important part from asset-related businesses. So I would expect that actually, the -- still the lion's share will need to come from revenue growth. We are still just when we look at that environment, we're just thinking that this is an opportunity phase. It is an opportunity phase because there is so much change. There is change in the competitive landscape, and there is change in the way how clients are served.</p><p>And if we make the call at our management discussions and when we discuss with our Board, should we try to reap the benefits of this environment of change and onboard the talent, build the technology? We always come to the conclusion, yes, we should and we do it. What should help through time is actually growth. You also -- I think that was hopefully one of the patterns we were able to bring across. I mean, you didn't hear a lot about new markets or completely new offering or completely new products. We have the intention to scale with capabilities we have and to scale these further, and that should be helpful. But we are not -- we manage costs, and you hear and see and hear about measures where we deliberately then obviously work on costs, do skill shifts, but we keep investing. So I would say the lion's share is expected in our plans. Coming from revenue growth on existing capabilities that should improve the scalability of the model.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Next question, Nicholas Herman, from Citi. For me, with a significant U.S. dollar weakening, what can you do to protect the bottom line, ensure that you can deliver the targets?</p><p>I mean, we are -- we are, of course, we have more revenues in U.S. dollar than we have costs. And so answer is simply given by that situation, we need to move cost into U.S. dollar. We're currently in the process of defining a couple of measures, which would include things like we want to denominate more of our contracts of our IT contracts, for example, in U.S. dollars. So what we're going to do is move the cost side a bit more towards the U.S. dollar. That's what we do.</p><p>Next question Nicholas Herman, again, annual growth and net new money targets, do these apply to all divisions? Or do you expect some divisions to grow faster than others?</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: I think that's one of the beauties also that we have a diversified and therefore, very robust model. So we tap into different segments. We also think that it makes a lot of sense. To have that because not all client units are going through the same life cycle in terms of product adoption and adoption of innovation. So we do also see different segments or business lines may be at different points. And then obviously, also on average, when all things -- when the stars align, B2B businesses scale faster than B2C businesses. We can't do anything against it. We will never change that. But on the other side, you get more resilience and more robustness.</p><p>So this is the average at the firm level. But it will not always be the same burden sharing in each and every half year. But through time, we are confident that with the business mix, we can make the aggregated targets.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Okay. Next one, Zeno, is also for you.</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: Yes.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: On the broader theme, the recent division reorganization and cost reallocation makes it difficult for the market to track divisional performance. You have also now removed divisional targets even at top line, which reduces divisional accountability. Can I ask why this is in the shareholder interest?</p><p>ZENO MARKUS STAUB: Yes. That's a very fair and good question, and we are getting a lot of it, and I'm happy to comment on that. And please allow me to voice a few broader ideas around that. So I think the -- we do not want to hide information from you, but we want to make sure that the organization acts as one firm focused on optimizing, a, value to our clients. And b, then, out of that, as a consequence, optimal profitability and value creation for our shareholders. And we just found that running the business center, you cannot have -- the way you report the business defines to a very large degree how you run the business.</p><p>And we found that the strict segment reporting of IFRS down to profit before tax was impossible to maintain with the idea of building one firm that shares capabilities and brings the best in the firm towards clients. Just think about the ultra-high net worth segments where we're now building and training bid, bringing business. As soon as you try to serve a very competitive market, you have an internal organization that stacks different profit centers on top of each other.</p><p>I can tell you that you spend a lot of time in internal negotiations, but then you will surely lose at the point of sales because your price is too high. So classic silo structures actually double internal profit center structures, and then they avoid sharing of capabilities and optimal leveraging of capabilities, just like the example of the megatrend capabilities that Axel mentioned across the different client units. So we are fully convinced that we need this setup in order to reap the best the firm can deliver.</p><p>Now how do we -- what do we give you as transparency? I think we still give you everything you need in order to charge how we are doing. You get revenues per client unit, you get margin per client units, you give net new money per client unit, you get the direct costs of all the client units and you're getting the direct costs of the 3 main centers of excellence. So you clearly see where our cost allocations are going. You see where the business is coming from, you see how the margins are doing, and you see how -- where the net new money is going.</p><p>But we just want to avoid is that by having to share with the public client and product profitability, which you have clearly heard from Thomas that we will continue to do it and probably even increasingly so in an after capital perspective, that would limit our internal ability to cooperate and would focus management time on cost allocation and not on revenue generation.</p><p>And I think the only consequence is of that change -- so you have to trust us to a certain degree that we are responsible to the fiduciary duty towards you that we, as a management team, are sensible capital allocators, but you will be able to monitor us and to make a decision. But as we have decided that we do not see ourselves as a company that happens to own a number of businesses, but we see ourselves as one firm, and that is a prerequisite to do the best we can.</p><p>We decided to change reporting levels, but we're very convinced this you get everything you need to measure us against the peers. And you get everything you need through time in order to judge if we do a decent job. But in the meantime, unfortunately, you have to make a call on us as your fiduciary agents for capital allocation.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Good. Next question is from Daniel Regli. Maybe again on the gross margins in wealth management, what are the key drivers for the future margin pressure, respectively? In which areas do you see the biggest margin pressure?</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER: Yes. I think -- okay, one of the driver, but that's too generalist, of course, overcapacity. There's still way too many wealth managers in almost any market in the world. But I think I would single out 2 areas that are very -- under very strong margin pressure. And then I think there's an area or where we believe it's less. So where it's less is, of course, in all the areas where we generate the value for the customers. That's on the mandates when we can prove that our Swiss equity mandate and/or our 3 alpha mandate has outperformed consistently. In the past, we are able to get a fair value for that. And there, we can defend margins.</p><p>I think the 2 areas that are under pressure is all pure custody and execution mandates. That is trending almost towards 0 with our large clients. And the second one is credit margins. It's, for many large clients, is not understandable why credit margins should be so far off of the capital market curve. And with that sense, we're actually happy that our credit penetration is much lower than many competitors.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Then a question from Nicholas Herman. From me again, the U.S. was 9% -- U.S. dollar was 9% of the H1 '20 costs, where do you aim to take that over time?</p><p>The U.S. dollar was a little bit more than 9% in the first half. What we aim to do is to get as close as this is possible matching the income and the expenses to take out of the P&amp;L and out of the fundamental P&amp;L, the currency risk and currency translation risk as far as this is possible. What we don't want to do is to start hedging these positions through swaps or other things because first of all, it's expensive. And secondly, if it goes in the wrong direction, it's always a relatively difficult discussion to have with everybody why we put on the wrong hedges. So that's a target. I cannot give you the target yet. We're collecting all of the information, and then we'll try to aspire to and as matched as possible, currency matched, cost and income side.</p><p>Then another question for wealth management. Does the plan involve more client asset growth or more increased share of wallet? Can you give us an indication of average share of wallet within wealth Management?</p><p>GEORG FRANZ FRIEDRICH SCHUBIGER: Well, the plan, of course, includes both, especially in the first half year, it was a lot of -- it was almost only possible to work with existing clients, but going forward, both. We don't communicate average share of wallet with above management. So unfortunately, I have to skip that one.</p><p>THOMAS ANTON HEINZL: Are there any more questions? Good. Then thank you very much. Thank you for all the questions. Thank you for the setup. We wish you all stay safe and all the best, and thank you for your interest in Vontobel.</p><p>[Thomson Financial reserves the right to make changes to documents, content, or other information on this web site without obligation to notify any person of such changes.</p><p>In the conference calls upon which Event Transcripts are based, companies may make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding a variety of items.

It's 11:00 on the East Coast. I'm Fredricka Whitfield.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A final deal for massive tax reform is now on the table. The U.S. Senate and the House coming to terms after some holdouts threatened to derail it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This brings <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>a big step forward toward his first major legislative victory. House Speaker <person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>saying the vote could come as early as Tuesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here are some of the key details. Despite a pledge to reduce the number of personal income tax brackets, this bill keeps all seven. Taxes will be lower for many of those brackets. The biggest cut is being saved for corporations, where the tax rate drops to 21 percent from its current 35 percent.</p><p>Also in the bill is a $2,000 child tax credit. That's important, because it apparently was a key in moving <person><nameText>Senator Marco Rubio's </nameText></person>vote from a no to a yes. Individuals will also be able to deduct up to $10,000 in state and local taxes, and the exemption for the estate tax would be doubled.</p><p>Republican senators got their way, and the Obamacare individual mandate will be eliminated.</p><p>CNN White House correspondent Abby Phillip is following the story for us from Washington, as the President is soon to make his way to Camp David.</p><p>So Abby -- it was just six weeks ago that lawmakers got a look at the first draft. There was a lot of horse trading to get the votes they need, including that from <person><nameText>Senators Marco Rubio </nameText></person>and <person><nameText>Bob Corker. </nameText></person>Does this White House worry about any other potential holdouts?</p><p>ABBY PHILLIP, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Well, the White House seems pretty confident that they actually do have the votes. That even though there are some senators who may not be publicly saying yes 100 percent I'm supporting this bill, they believe that those people will eventually be in their camp.</p><p>One of those is Mike Lee, who has said that he just wants to -- he wants to read the bill before he makes a final decision. But again, he's someone that many Republicans, most Republicans believe will finally come over.</p><p>And as you mentioned, <person><nameText>Marco Rubio, </nameText></person><person><nameText>Bob Corker </nameText></person>coming onboard on Friday was a really big deal. <person><nameText>Marco Rubio </nameText></person>saying definitively he would not vote for this bill unless they moved in his direction on the child tax credit. They did just that.</p><p>And <person><nameText>Bob Corker </nameText></person>dropping some of his opposition to the bill on the basis of the deficit; he's not really talking too much about that. And he said that he'll go ahead and support it.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Abby Phillip -- thank you so much from the White House. We'll check back with you.</p><p>All right. Right now I want to bring in congressional reporter Lauren Fox. So Lauren -- good to see you. So what did the President perhaps give up in order to get this far in this bill?</p><p>LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER: Well, we have to remember that the President is on the verge of a major legislative victory here, something that Republicans in Congress have not been able to give him for the entire year. But with a victory comes some things that you have to be willing to give up on.</p><p>And one of those things for President <person><nameText>Donald Trump </nameText></person>was the corporate tax rate. When they began this debate, excuse me, one of the things that the President wanted was a 15 percent corporate tax rate. That was just too expensive. What they've settled on now is a 21 percent corporate tax rate. That's down from 35 percent.</p><p>And one other thing that they did was, as we mentioned earlier, <person><nameText>Marco Rubio </nameText></person>said he would not vote for this bill without an expansion of the child tax credit. So in a last-minute scramble, GOP leaders gave him an expansion of the refundability portion of that tax credit. That's a major win for <person><nameText>Marco Rubio, </nameText></person>but something else that Republicans had to give on.</p><p>WHITFIELD: So, Lauren -- what about the potential deficit, the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation says this bill could increase the deficit by almost $1.5 trillion. Are there any Republicans openly worried about that? And, you know, saying that just might give them some hesitation over a vote?</p><p>FOX: Well, in the beginning of this debate, Senator <person><nameText>Bob Corker </nameText></person>said that he was deeply concerned about the deficit. He did not want to vote for a bill that added one penny to the deficit. But yesterday in a big surprise he released a statement that said he now plans to vote for this bill. So clearly that's been a big change here.</p><p>And I can't actually identify anyone in the U.S. Senate now who's saying that the deficit is going to be what keeps them from voting for this tax bill. So that's, obviously, a major change. WHITFIELD: All right. Lauren Fox -- thanks so much. Good to see you, appreciate it. &gt;</p><p>FOX: Thank you.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Let's talk some more about this with our political panel. David Swerdlick is a CNN political commentator and an assistant editor at the \"Washington Post\". And Patrick Healy is a CNN political analyst and a \"New York Times\" editor. Good to see you both.</p><p>All right. So David -- you first.</p><p>Some say it's not reform, instead just a new plan. So if that's the case, does it still mean this is a victory, potentially, for the President?</p><p>[11:05:03] DAVID SWERDLICK, CNN POLITICAL COMMENTATOR: I think it has to be looked at as a political at least victory for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>after a year where the narrative, which was really true, that he had not notched a major legislative win was the case.</p><p>Now if this passes next week, which by all accounts it looks like it will, he will be able to end the year saying he had a major legislative win.</p><p>So I don't see that there's any other way to look at that. The President will tout it. I think Republicans will cheer this going into 2018 when they have to defend their seats in congress.</p><p>That being said, you know, the criticisms of the bill remain, that it benefits wealthier earners and investors more than middle class people, that it adds between $1 and $1.5 trillion to the deficit. And as Lauren said, there's really no one out there making the argument that this will be good for long-term for the deficit and what the administration is going to have to bank on now is this idea that this is going to bring economic growth, even though most mainstream economic analyses suggest that it may not do what Republicans say it will do.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And then, Patrick -- you know, there are congressional leaders that are saying they have the votes, that this seems inevitable that it will pass. But then remember one of the latest go around for health care reform, John McCain, you know, giving his thumbs down. There could potentially be a moment like this for this bill, no?</p><p>PATRICK HEALY, CNN POLITICAL ANALYST: I think, you know, 48 hours ago it looked like there would be more opportunities for surprise moments; this time maybe not so much.</p><p>I mean you see John McCain, who made such a difference, as you said, Fred, on that health care bill, but now he is coming out in favor of this tax plan; so is <person><nameText>Bob Corker. </nameText></person>Those are two of your biggest deficit hawks that have been out there and they are willing to essentially kind of buy in to the idea that this change in tax rates, certainly on the corporate side and for high end earners, will lead to, you know, from their point of view a kind of stimulus for the economy that will generate revenue.</p><p>So in terms of the number of, you know, possible x factors, you know, certainly you've got Jeff Flake from Arizona who's not running for re- election. You've got Susan Collins, who has to have concerns about that repeal of the individual mandate that's being planned, you know.</p><p>There are -- certainly, you know, Thad Cochran, you know, and John McCain, they say that they'll be there, but that's still up in the air. Mike Lee is reading. So --</p><p>WHITFIELD: But I wonder if it makes a difference that, you know, a lot of these lawmakers are back, you know, in their hometowns. Their constituents will give them an earful potentially this weekend, whereas many of these lawmakers were kind of celebrating before the weekend. But now as of yesterday it's public. And I wonder if that in any way could potentially influence them.</p><p>HEALY: It's a little less likely. I mean in terms of one senator (INAUDIBLE) that come out in favor of a bill, coming back on Monday and saying, you know, I've heard this overwhelming shout from, you know, constituents going to change my mind. It's not like the summertime where there are usually those series of town halls where, you know, representatives can leave Washington thinking one way and then come back and feeling such pressure.</p><p>So that's a little less likely.</p><p>WHITFIELD: David?</p><p>SWERDLICK: Fred -- can I just -- can I just add to that? Yes.</p><p>So look, even though polls show that a lot of Americans don't feel that this tax bill is actually going to help them significantly or at all, I agree with Patrick. It seems very unlikely to me that Americans, that Republican voters particularly, are going to punish their members of Congress for voting for this, even if it doesn't have some immediate effect.</p><p>I think after a year we see that the idea that people voted for <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>or for their members of Congress just because they thought a tax cut would be stimulative is a little bit thin.</p><p>People who are still with the President are getting what they want out of him in terms of some of the culture war issues that he's brought up. Some of the tone change that he's brought in Washington.</p><p>He inherited a robust economy from President Obama and it continues to be robust. So if the economy stays good, I don't think people will punish the President for this, even if they, you know, privately think it's not really changing.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And that operative word \"immediate\" because as soon, you know, January and February people just might see a little bit more in their paycheck as a result of all these taxes. But it's kind of the long-term or even -- maybe even midterm.</p><p>We're talking 2018, you know, Patrick, where if, you know, voters end up seeing or experiencing that this becomes the massive tax cut for the rich and the big corporations, might Republicans be, you know, feeling it in a different way come midterm elections?</p><p>HEALY: They could gain a benefit, Fred. And David just said something that's really important that I want to return to. I mean right now, you know, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>for this, you know, first year has been largely like a culture warrior president. I mean really he's focused on these cultural issues. In terms of accomplishments it's really been just Neil Gorsuch getting to the Supreme Court, that's basically been it.</p><p>[11:09:54] But now he's going and he's played to his base with his tweets, with his rallies so much of the time. But now if they do get this major tax cut, they'll be able to go more to those kind of traditional country club Republicans, the business establishment that has sort of seen <person><nameText>President Trump, </nameText></person>you know, sort of sounding off on Twitter the way that he does and this will be, you know, a big fat gift.</p><p>And it's a gift, also to David's point, that really the Obama economy, that the series of decisions by President Obama, has led to this much stronger economy that gives the ability of the Republicans to give these tax cuts.</p><p>But you can believe it, Fred -- that throughout 2018, the Republicans will be running on this. And it will be likely that some people will gain some benefits, will feel it, and some of that credit will probably go to Republican incumbents.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Let me shift gears a little bit.</p><p>I want to talk about this CDC moment, the Centers for Disease Control, and what David, your paper is reporting. That the <person><nameText>Trump administration </nameText></person>has sent the agency by way of someone who is leading the finance office of the CDC sort of a list of banned words and phrases. seven of them including \"vulnerable\", \"entitlement\", \"diversity\", \"transgender\", \"fetus\", \"evidence-based\", and \"science- based\"; and to eliminate those words from any kind of policies or written material within the CDC.</p><p>So, David -- two of your reporters got wind of this by way of anonymous sources who were at that meeting, because this wasn't in an official capacity information coming from the CDC. Why? You know, is there an explanation as to why there is the banning of this kind of vernacular?</p><p>SWERDLICK: So, Fred -- I've got to say, first of all, it's a great reporting as always by my \"Washington Post\" colleagues. If, indeed, this is the direction that the administration is going, and it's coming top-down, it suggests to me, frankly, that this is showing that Republicans who have made political correctness, made hay out of political correctness for years turn out to be the snowflakiest of the snowflakes when it comes to words that seem to offend their ideological sensibilities.</p><p>You can disagree on policy, whether it has to do with health policy or transgender rights or any of these other words that are implicated on this list that's being reported out. But the idea -- even if you're against transgender rights or you're against the idea of transgender identity, it is a thing.</p><p>So to ban a word like that or to ban some of these other terms suggest something that's almost Soviet in a way. You know, we'll see what happens as this story goes forward.</p><p>WHITFIELD: I mean Patrick -- it really smacks of control.</p><p>HEALY: right.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Control of people's thinking and action and perhaps even dismissal. If you don't see it, then perhaps you don't think it's there.</p><p>HEALY: Well, George Orwell wrote, you know, a great piece called \"1984\" that got at this. I mean sort of the Orwellian language of thought control, of thought police, of words that you could and couldn't say. And as we know from that work, it was a very slippery slope into a really, you know, kind of top-down way of thinking for a society. And that is not healthy.</p><p>This is a country that is founded on free speech. It's certainly a country that, you know, has had major divisions and in progress we've tried to look that in the face. People who weren't comfortable with transgender people 20 years ago, I mean the degree of at least if not acceptance, at least sort of understanding that these are fellow Americans and that people should be treated with some kind of respect.</p><p>And then for basically the government to come forward and say, well, we're not even going to use the word to describe you is -- it feels Orwellian. And I guess I'd say, Fred -- the question is why.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes.</p><p>HEALY: We still don't know. This is great reporting by \"The Post\", but you know, you assume innocent until proven guilty -- well that might not be right phrase - - but why, why is this being done?</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes, it's very curious and in the reporting of your paper, \"Washington Post\", David -- apparently this meeting or this instruction was led by Allison Kelly, a senior leader in the agency, CDC's office of financial services, according to the sources that your reporters spoke to. It is very curious.</p><p>All this while, of course, the nominee for the department of Health and Human Services, you know. That confirmation still hasn't happened. So still unclear, you know, who's delivering the message, you know, to this financial, you know, services officer. How did that get disseminated?</p><p>All right. David Swerdlick, Patrick Healy -- thank you so much. HEALY: Thanks -- Fred.</p><p>SWERDLICK: Thanks -- Fred.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Still ahead, U.S. Secretary of State <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>and the North Korean ambassador addressed the United Nations Security Council as both sides accuse the other of escalating nuclear tensions. This as Senator Lindsey Graham warns there's a, quote, \"30 percent chance\", end quote, <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>will attack North Korea.</p><p>[11:15:02] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: Welcome back.</p><p>An aggressive warning from North Korea to <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>today; state media also mocking and referring to Trump as an old lunatic and claiming he was frightened by North Korea's latest missile test.</p><p>The comments coming just hours after a strong statement by secretary of State <person><nameText>Rex Tillerson </nameText></person>to North Korea at a U.N. Security Council meeting.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>REX TILLERSON, </nameText></person>UNITED STATES SECRETARY OF STATE: As I said earlier this week, a sustained cessation of North Korea's threatening behavior must occur before talks can begin. North Korea must earn its way back to the table. The pressure campaign must and will continue until denuclearization is achieved. We will in the meantime keep our channels of communication open.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[11:20:02] WHITFIELD: All right. I'm joined now by Elise Labott, CNN global affairs correspondent. So Elise -- good to see you. Explain these comments from North Korea today.</p><p>ELISE LABOTT, CNN GLOBAL AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Fred -- I mean, I think we have to, you know, just kind of chock this up to the usual rhetoric of North Korea, you know, obviously in particular with <person><nameText>President Trump. </nameText></person>Kim Jong-Un and <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>have really gotten under each other's skin and are trading barbs.</p><p>I think what was more fundamental and important was that U.N. Security Council meeting yesterday. Secretary of State Tillerson, you know, a little bit stronger of a message than we've seen from him, but still leaving the door open for diplomacy and the North Korean ambassador actually sitting in the hall.</p><p>Now, it's very rare for any North Korean official to be addressing the U.N. Security Council. They are always delegitimizing the Security Council.</p><p>But there was a U.N. official that visited recently, Jeff Feltman. And he said to the North Koreans, listen, you have to start engaging with the council. You need to start, you know, trying to fix this. And I think even though, you know, the North Korean ambassador was, you know, full of the typical rhetoric, I think the fact that him and Secretary Tillerson and the other members of the council were sitting and addressing each other, you know, while may not have had any breakthroughs, obviously, I think it is significant.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And then on Tuesday, you know, Tillerson said the U.S. was ready to start talks with North Korea without preconditions. It seems that a mixed message was also sent. Can the Secretary have it both ways?</p><p>LABOTT: Well, I think he's trying to have it both ways. I mean I don't think he means that there's no preconditions for a deal. I think what he was trying to say is there's no preconditions for you and I to have a conversation about starting negotiations.</p><p>I mean clearly, the U.S. has its bottom line on nuclear, you know, talks or nuclear negotiation, which would be North Korea has to give up, you know, be willing to talk about giving up its nuclear program.</p><p>But I think what he's trying to do is you've seen nothing from the North Koreans about wanting any type of dialogue. I think he's trying to coax them to the table. He knows that the Chinese are looking for that.</p><p>The North Koreans have been sending now some signals through intermediaries and through the Russians, you know, asking -- you know, more curious about talks. And so I don't think when Secretary Tillerson says no preconditions he means there are no preconditions for a nuclear deal. What he's saying is, let's just, you know, kind of work towards diplomacy.</p><p>And, you know, clearly it was a mixed message and I think what you see playing out is, you know, there are different approaches in this administration about how to deal with North Korea. I mean, everyone has the same goal, but I think the tactics, you know, we're seeing those differences play out.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And then, Elise -- you know, Tillerson's comments coming at a rather rare moment at the United Nations when North Korea's representative actually had something to say, and in English.</p><p>LABOTT: That's right. I mean, as I said, Jeff Feltman, this undersecretary for political affairs like the maybe third top official at the U.N. is an American, used to be an American diplomat at the State Department. Went there, had 15 hours, Fred, of discussions with the North Koreans.</p><p>Now, were there any breakthroughs? No, there weren't. But, you know, for the first time the North Koreans seemed to be engaging him and debating him and talking about these kinds of issues. So when he said to them, you need to start talking to the U.N. Security Council. You need -- if you want to fix this, you need to move towards diplomacy.</p><p>And he didn't get any, you know, positive messages. It still looks like the North Koreans are moving ahead on the nuclear program, but at the same time you did see that North Korean ambassador come to the hall, you know, they are always talking about delegitimizing the council, addressing the council in English.</p><p>I think that, again, we didn't see any breakthroughs, but I think his presence there yesterday was significant and something that the U.N. may hope to build on. Maybe it's not the U.S. that starts talking with the North Koreans right away. Maybe the U.N. starts to try and coax them to more of a diplomatic stance. We'll just have to see.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Yes. There was some inference there, sometimes it's not what you say, but sometimes just how you say it and in which language.</p><p>LABOTT: Exactly. Yes.</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. Elise Labott -- thank you so much. &gt;</p><p>All right. Still ahead, <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>lawyers set to meet with the special counsel Robert Mueller and team in the coming days. So what could this mean for the Russia investigation going forward as <person><nameText>President Trump </nameText></person>refuses to rule out pardoning Michael Flynn?</p><p>[11:24:28] (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, welcome back.</p><p>The Russia investigation could be headed for a pivotal moment next week. Sources say a key meeting is set to take place between <person><nameText>President Trump's </nameText></person>private lawyers and the special counsel. Meanwhile, the President's team is hoping the investigation is coming to an end.</p><p>CNN justice correspondent Evan Perez has more.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>EVAN PEREZ, CNN JUSTICE CORRESPONDENT: Sources tell us that the President's lawyers are planning to meet with special counsel Robert Mueller and his team, we're told, as soon as the coming week for what the President lawyers hope will be a chance to find out the next steps in the Mueller investigation.</p><p>The Trump legal team, led by John Dowd and Jay Sekulow is hoping that they can see signs that the end is near in Mueller's investigation.</p><p>Now, they've had other meetings, but here's why this one is of significance. The White House says that everyone who works there and who Mueller has asked to interview has now gone in for an interview.</p><p>One of the last happened earlier last week, when White House counsel Don McGahn sat down for his interview. The White House has also finished turning over documents requested by the special counsel.</p><p>There's been no request to interview the President or the Vice President, we're told. We have a statement from Sekulow and he says, quote, \"We do not and will not discuss our periodic communications with the special counsel. [11:30:02] And of course, Trump lawyers know that Mueller could still come back to ask for more interviews and for more documents. And it's important to note that there's no requirement for Mueller to give them any information.</p><p>They are hoping he's going to show his cards and there's a chance he won't do that. The Mueller investigation is actually moving relatively quickly, compared to typical white collar criminal investigations that often stretch into years.</p><p>He's been on the job seven months or so and already Mueller has brought charges against four people, including two who have pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI, but that's not fast enough for the president and his supporters. The bottom line is that the president and Republicans want the cloud of this investigation lifted. Evan Perez, CNN, New York.</p><p>FREDRICKA WHITFIELD, CNN ANCHOR: All right, thanks so much, Evan. Let's talk more about all of this. I'm joined now by Tom Fuentes, who is a CNN senior law enforcement analyst and former FBI assistant director. Good to see you, Tom.</p><p>All right. So, what's the expectation, it's not unusual for attorneys on both sides to have, like, a discussion, but typically what happens after that discussion?</p><p>TOM FUENTES, CNN SENIOR LAW ENFORCEMENT ANALYST: Well, you're right. It's typical to have the discussion. It's not typical to say what was discussed or any conclusions that were made from it. I think, you know, right now the speculation is that it must be -- the investigation must be coming near to an end.</p><p>But, you know, we don't know if we'll find out more along those lines after they have the meeting or not. We may, but there's been very, very little information leaking from the Mueller investigation to know what possibly will come from that meeting.</p><p>WHITFIELD: And this meeting comes after the president on the White House lawn, you know, was asked about the idea of potentially pardoning Michael Flynn. This is what he had to say.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p><person><nameText>DONALD TRUMP, </nameText></person>PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: See what happens next week. I can say this, when you look at what's gone on with the FBI and the Justice Department, people are very, very angry. Thank you very much.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, that was difficult to hear, but essentially, he says, you know, he doesn't want to talk about pardons yet and he also said kind of, we'll see. We don't know if the meeting, you know, this coming week after the president said if there's any real correlation.</p><p>But if you were on Mueller's team, what do you do with this kind of statement coming from the president when asked about pardons and he says I don't want to talk about it yet, and then he also says we'll see?</p><p>FUENTES: Well, the fear for the Mueller team is how much did they need the cooperation and testimony of Michael Flynn? Because if Trump was to pardon him and take away any incentive to cooperate, and they don't have anybody else that's ready to go to testify or provide other information, especially with regard to collusion or obstruction of justice, then, you know, it kind of stops their investigation in its tracks.</p><p>Much like more than 10 years ago when Special Counsel Fitzgerald and the FBI were investigating Scooter Libby, who was working for the Vice President Dick Cheney and it was regarding the outing of Valerie Plain, a CIA case officer. You recall in that case, you know, the president, Bush, commuted the sentence.</p><p>Meaning he wouldn't pardon him, which would completely exonerate him, but it kept him going to jail and essentially it shut that case down. There was no incentive anymore for Libby to cooperate and provide testimony against anyone else, which possibly could have included the vice president.</p><p>WHITFIELD: I wonder in this case, though, because Mueller's team may have learned from precedence, too, that perhaps they already have an expectation of what kind of information to get out of Michael Flynn, before they even cut that deal. So, they may already have all the goods, so to speak, in order to proceed.</p><p>Might that be the thinking that, you know, if Michael Flynn doesn't deliver completely on what was promised, Mueller's team already potentially knows whether or not he's kind of changed the deal?</p><p>FUENTES: Well, maybe, but again, if the president pardons him, that's it. They are not going to be able to put any other pressure on him, you know, in terms of additional prosecution or possibly going to jail or any of that, so that would be a game changer, and again --</p><p>WHITFIELD: And it would certainly look even more -- that would really cement an obstruction building the case.</p><p>FUENTES: Well, in one sense, but on the other hand, it would cement that it was a weak case if it's that contingent on one person and that one person is Michael Flynn. So, you could look at that both ways as proof of the president trying to hold the case up or the other way around.</p><p>So, I think that we're going to have to wait and see what happens with that, but, you know, again Mueller's team knows what they have and what Flynn can provide, because that would have been part of the deal, but, you know, that might be what they are discussing is what to expect as the case goes forward in that. We just don't know at this point.</p><p>[11:35:09] WHITFIELD: Gotcha. All right, very complicated. Tom Fuentes, thank you so much. FUENTES: You're welcome.</p><p>WHITFIELD: Still so much more straight ahead in the NEWSROOM.</p><p>But first, preparing for your next trip can be as simple as picking up your smartphone.

The Senate has confirmed 12 appellate court judges in the president's first year, a modern record, but some of Trump's nominees have come under fire for their extreme lack of experience or basic legal knowledge.</p><p>The latest example is Matthew Petersen, a commissioner on the Federal Election Commission. Here's part of a jaw-dropping exchange with Republican Senator John Kennedy from a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Peterson's nomination. Take a look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISIANA: Can you just raise your hand on this one, if you will, to save a little time?

Have you ever argued a motion in state court?</p><p>PETERSEN: I have not.</p><p>KENNEDY: Have you ever argued a motion in federal court?</p><p>PETERSEN: No.</p><p>KENNEDY: Can you tell me what the Dobare standard is?</p><p>PETERSEN: Senator Kennedy, I don't have that right away at my disposal.</p><p>KENNEDY: Do you know what a motion in Limine is?</p><p>PETERSEN: I would probably not give you a good definition at the table.</p><p>KENNEDY: OK. Do you know what the younger abstention doctrine is?</p><p>PETERSEN: I've heard of it, but I --</p><p>KENNEDY: How about the Pullman extension doctrine?

She was tasked with improving African- American outreach, but how successful was she at bridging the gap between the White House and the black community? We'll talk about that next.</p><p>[11:48:07]</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right, welcome back. She served as the top ranking African-American in the senior staff of the White House before announcing her resignation this week, but Omarosa Manigault-Newman's discussion of race is hitting a nerve in the black community, where many say she did not represent them. CNN's Randi Kaye takes a closer look.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>RANDI KAYE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At the White House, Omarosa Manigault-Newman's job was to reach out to African-Americans, improve relations, and get their support for the president's agenda.

New York and several other states are suing to stop the FCC from repealing net neutrality protections and Democratic members of Congress are also vowing to put up a fight to restore the rules that prevented companies from slowing down or blocking access to online content.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER (D), MINORITY LEADER: I'm announcing my support for a congressional review act resolution that will restore net neutrality and undo the evil repeal of it by the FCC. All we need is a majority vote in the House and a majority vote in the Senate and it happens.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WHITFIELD: So, what does the controversial repeal mean for you? CNN's John Sarland breaks it all down.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>JOHN SARLAND, CNN CORRESPONDENT: If the internet is a highway, vehicles are content providers, can't pay more to use a special fast lane. Think of it this way, all content is created equal in the eyes of the internet provider. That's the basic tenet behind net neutrality.</p><p>If the internet is neutral, then the internet providers are treated basically by public utilities. Comcast or AT&amp;T couldn't slow down or speed up certain content like Netflix or Hulu.</p><p>But if net neutrality ends, some companies are going to be stuck in that slow lane and customers might stop using sites that never seem to load. The rules that made the net neutral were put in place during the Obama administration.</p><p>FORMER PRESIDENT OBAMA: This set of principle, the idea of net neutrality, has unleashed the power of the internet and given innovators the chance to thrive.</p><p>SARLAND: But now things are going in a different direction. Ajit Pai, the chairman of the FCC is a former lawyer for Verizon.</p><p>AJIT PAI, CHAIRMAN, FCC: Entrepreneurs are constantly developing new technologies and services, but too often, they're unable to bring them to market for consumers because outdated rules or regulatory inertia stand in the way.</p><p>SARLAND: To him, repealing net neutrality will lead to innovation that will get the government out of, quote, \"micromanaging the internet.\" The internet providers will have more money, they'll invest more in infrastructure and we'll have faster streaming. While deregulation certainly has earned the praise of the telecommunications industry, on the other side, you have tech companies and consumer advocacy groups.</p><p>ALEXIS OHANIAN, CO-FOUNDER, REDDIT: We don't want our internet to look like our television cable. We don't want tiered access. We don't want all the things that have stifled innovation and other industries.</p><p>SARLAND: But those who want to keep net neutrality intact, it's a matter of internet freedom. Repeal would mean that internet service providers can choose how affordable and how fast certain content is. That is, they'll be a slow lane and a fast lane.</p><p>So, this summer, some big tech giants like Facebook, Google, Netflix, they participated in a day of action to advocate for net neutrality. But really, it's the small companies and the start-ups that have the most to lose if net neutrality ends.</p><p>They don't have the deep pockets to pay the toll to access that faster lane. The open question now, will repeal of net neutrality lead to innovation or to a traffic jam?</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>WHITFIELD: All right. In the fast lane and the slow lane with John Sarland there.

Europe\u2019s GDPR and California\u2019s CPA have set out the legal frameworks for new requirements for privacy compliance, and Apple\u2019s ITP safeguards block the use of 3 rd party cookies on their devices. Google is committed to following this, with similar blocks for its Chrome browser by 2022.    There are going to be some online targeting tactics that you will not be able to deploy in this new world, and for users with iPhones and Apple Mac computers, those tactics are already significantly curtailed. By 2022 there will be a whole raft of use cases in targeting tools like DMPs (Data Management Platforms) that will be rendered useless on the vast majority of devices.    So, what can you do? Are we set back to the days of purely contextual targeting, in which you bought the \u201ceyeballs\u201d of customers of a specific financial product or a given industrial sector by advertising in their vertical trade journal? Do we just have to send the same ad to everyone, and hope that some of them are in the market for our niche products?    Moving towards the end of 3rd party cookies    For marketers of financial products and services, these are important questions because managing your audiences is important for avoiding waste and for addressing your engaged clients and prospects in targeted and effective ways. The ability to track and remarket to customers has been a mainstay of digital marketing for the past decade. This has all been enabled by the dropping of cookies \u2013 files that sit on your PC and record your browsing activity. With moves from regulators and tech companies to protect user anonymity, the cookie while not quite dead, is certainly crumbling.    The upshot is that marketers cannot rely on 3 rd party data anymore and should be wary of how any use of 3 rd party data will be viewed by the regulator. This renders even the most basic consumer journey starting with a mobile search and ending with a desktop ecommerce transaction hard to measure in many cases. But the use of anonymized 1 st party data can still yield critical insights, and this is where we need to focus our efforts.    From individual to anonymized data    So, what has fundamentally changed in digital measurement? The overarching shift is from a world where brands could access the log-file data of each individual user to a world of anonymized user behaviour, based on vast pools of data.    The ownership of these data pools and the ability to collect and model it sits with the brand that has the direct contact with the consumer. For large banks, insurance and pension companies, this is a resource for efficient and effective digital marketing, based on aggregated insights. For the adtech giants \u2013 Google, Amazon, Facebook \u2013 this will provide increased levels of targeting options within their tools.    The adtech identity graph    Google are in some ways the most advanced in delivering a scalable solution, which is worth examining. Google uses an undisclosed, supposedly huge sample of users for which they have collected the right consent first. They can accurately track across publishers, devices and even offline channels. From this they extrapolate to the entire population, applying machine learning or more traditional online polling. The end report is always aggregated and only available above a certain volume threshold. Facebook and Amazon are constantly developing similar aggregated audiences for targeting with their inventory.    These audience aggregation capabilities may appear to be similar to Nielsen\u2019s panel-based measurement model. But this really is digital marketing on rocket fuel. It allows brands to leverage the tech brands\u2019 enormous identity graphs and universal app tracking capabilities. And because their identity graphs are vast and data collection in real-time, the final estimate is not only accurate, but most of all, granular and actionable \u2013 the two main limitations of traditional panel-based systems.    Google launches machine-learning managed ad frequency  Practical applications of these tools are valuable to marketers. For examples, Google has recently announced the launch of a new machine-learning powered feature to manage ad frequency across its Google Ad Manager platform. It will predict how many times a user was exposed to an ad for reach and frequency analysis, based on its undisclosed sample of users who Google can track with full certainty.    This announcement comes after some similar releases across the entire stack. \u2018Cross-environment estimated conversions\u2019 will show you when customers convert on the same device, as well as when customers click a search ad on one device or browser but convert in a different environment. These are rich insights enabling you to optimize any campaigns.    Integrating the new reports into decision-making    Financial marketers will use these new features as they become available in the Google Marketing Platform, but it is also vital for these decision-makers to have their own measures of effectiveness and performance. Most of the features above are still in Beta, rarely compatible with third party systems and often difficult to export. While many media agencies are judged on \u2018cost per acquisition\u2019, this is far more difficult in a world where the conversion is estimated and therefore not auditable. This makes it absolutely essential for brand marketers to undertake their own measurement frameworks and integrate insights into their own sales and demand trackers.    The secret lies in your 1st party data given the fact that it is comparatively less impacted than 3rd party data, with the one-day notice in Safari and as-yet unaffected in Chrome. There is still a scope for projects that focus on maximizing how you capture and use your first person data, both to employ smarter segmentation of your media activation, and to obtain insights by separating out your Chrome from your ITP lines to tailor your campaign activation and measurement.    Richard Wheaton    It will also be valuable for marketers in finance sectors to use their own data to build better targeting capabilities, and to monitor and validate the information they are getting from the large tech companies, whose insights are otherwise largely unauditable.    There is also a time-limit to the availability of these measurable insights, because when Google removes open-ended access to your 1st party cookies, the ability of brands to obtain these insights will reduced to almost zero.    A measurement mindset    While people might mourn the loss of the present system, in truth very few brands have had the genuine discipline or technical knowledge to make their measurement truly insightful. And in reality, even for brands that made the effort to obtain genuinely robust data, the figures in their analyses were not 100% accurate, with data discrepancies and ad fraud skewing the findings providing a false picture. Some will also be uncomfortable with the aggregation of power within the big tech companies, but the options will be increasingly few to work outside their platforms.    In the post-cookie world, what is really required is a change of mindset when measuring performance, which will be as important to you as the tools and technology that you use. We are in a new era and those who are prepared to adapt their thinking are best placed to succeed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43133491521</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60WT-WF11-F07F-80X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1306\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Global Banking &amp;

Many virtual private network (VPN) operators keep servers in the city, serving mainland users who want to conceal their internet activity or access websites blocked by the Chinese authority.</p><p><br/>But some VPN providers are reevaluating the risks of keeping their servers in Hong Kong upon the enactment of the national security law, which critics warn could compromise user privacy and have a chilling effect on free speech. Under the new legal framework, internet service providers will be required to turn over user data to the authorities.<br/>VPN services are gaining ground globally as they claim to provide better privacy from users' internet providers and sites visited, although they could be vulnerable to attacks if not properly secured.<br/>In response to the new security rules, TunnelBear, a Toronto-based VPN service acquired by McAfee in 2018, announced it will remove all of its Hong Kong servers \"to ensure the safety\" of its users.<br/>The company stressed that it does not store any personally identifiable information on its servers, so the decision to remove Hong Kong from its server list is to \"protect our configuration keys\" and \"monitor the reach of the new security law on technical ecosystems in Hong Kong.\"<br/>Other popular VPN services we contacted said they will keep their servers in Hong Kong for now. ProtonVPN, operated by the same Swiss company that owns ProtonMail, said although it's not removing its Hong Kong-based servers, it has changed the designation of the region to a high-risk jurisdiction, giving it the extra layer of privacy protection as countries like Russia, Turkey and Vietnam.<br/>\"Our use of full disk encryption and a strict no-logs policy greatly limits the potential risk to activists and dissidents if the Chinese government were to move against our servers in Hong Kong,\" Proton's spokesperson Edward Shone told TechCrunch, adding that users who connect to Hong Kong are advised to activate a special feature that makes it \"far more difficult\" to locate their true IP address.<br/>Panama-headquartered NordVPN will also keep its servers in Hong Kong. \"All of our servers are either diskless or encrypted, so even a physical takeover wouldn't compromise our users' privacy,\" said NordVPN spokesperson Laura Tyrell. The company observed a huge spike in inquiries for its service in Hong Kong - by a factor of 120 times - shortly after China announced the upcoming law in May. It has since added more servers in the surrounding regions, including Hong Kong, to \"keep up with the velocities.\"<br/>A spokesperson for ExpressVPN, which is registered in the British Virgin Islands, told TechCrunch it currently doesn't have plans to remove Hong Kong as a server location option for users because its \"VPN servers are already specifically architected not to contain personal or sensitive data on customers.\"<br/>Its proprietary technology\u00a0ensures servers run only on volatile memory (RAM), not on hard drives. \"As a result, no data, including certificates or credentials, can persist after a system is powered down, whether because it is rebooted or physically removed from a data center,\" added the spokesperson.<br/>But all the VPN companies we contacted said they are closely monitoring the impact and enforcement bodies of Hong Kong's new security law and will react accordingly to safeguard user interests.<br/>Apple removal?The VPN providers we spoke to are still accessible in Hong Kong, but it's not inconceivable to see app stores start removing VPNs from the city under the new legal framework, as Apple did during a crackdown back in 2017 to comply with Chinese regulations that illegalized VPNs without official approval.<br/>As Shames Abdelwahab, the spokesperson for TunnelBear, observed: \"We can speak to the fact that distribution is often hit first as the first stage of cyber censorship.\"<br/>\"We are, of course, concerned about users' ability to access privacy and security services like VPNs, and we have experienced our app being removed from app stores in countries like China,\" said the ExpressVPN spokesperson.<br/>Apple, whose business heavily depends on China, has drawn a barrage of criticism in recent years for accommodating Beijing's censorship demands. Besides banning VPNs, it has also restricted Chinese and foreign podcasts. Chinese users can still retrieve these apps by switching to a different regional app store, but the registration process is cumbersome, as it usually requires a foreign address, phone number and credit card.<br/>Apple cannot be immediately reached for comment on the story.<br/>Proton's Shone echoed the concern over an Apple ban: \"Our worry is that the Hong Kong authorities will begin demanding the removal of news apps, communications apps and VPNs and Apple will obey to maintain market access to mainland China. Tim Cook and others are due to give evidence on Capitol Hill later this month as part of an antitrust investigation into big tech.\"<br/>\"We sincerely hope that this issue of censorship will form part of the questioning,\" he said.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GREENT-M1246719</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GREENT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60DT-F681-DYDW-715C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">422724</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"864\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 FFC Information Solution Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Greentechlead.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 23, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

For example, in 2019, an increasing number of partnerships were formed between large multinationals including Dell, Microsoft, and AT&amp;T, and smaller tech providers and VR/AR technology companies. The rationale behind many of these partnerships is health-related, spanning from improving neurosurgery, bringing VR/AR hardware into labs and clinics, and advancing commercialization standards for prescription digital medicines, as well as combining with emerging 5G to improve latency during surgery and remote patient monitoring.VR and AR technologies have traditionally been associated with the entertainment industry, with virtual and immersive environments used for gamers, product designers, and architects. However, there are myriad possibilities for VR/AR technology in the healthcare sector, including medical education, image-guided treatment, the treatment of neuropsychological conditions, and visual impairment, as well as use in rehabilitation, which have fueled the need for this technology across the healthcare industry. As a result, the development of VR/AR technologies requires investment and collaboration between big tech, start-ups, and players across the entire healthcare ecosystem.Technology giants are increasingly moving into the healthcare space, and while tech investment in health is not new, Mergers and Acquisitions (M&amp;A) are increasing in value and number year-on-year, as well as the size of the players involved. Recent examples include Apple's acquisition of Akonia Holographics, an AR smart glasses company, and the buyout of Tueo Health's asthma monitoring start-up, both for undisclosed amounts.Increasing partnerships and M&amp;A activity in the area reflect that there are huge opportunities which are yet to materialize. The future of VR/AR in healthcare will depend on collaborations and M&amp;A, which will play a huge role over the next five years in moving this technology forward from concept to reality in the healthcare industry.The Virtual/Augmented Reality in Healthcare - Thematic Research report provides an assessment of the key healthcare, macroeconomic, technology, and regulatory themes impacting how VR/AR technologies are being used in healthcare today, and how this technology is expected to affect the healthcare sector in the future.Reasons to Buy</p><p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Develop and design your corporate strategies through an in-house expert analysis of the key VR/AR applications impacting the healthcare industry.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Develop business strategies by understanding how VR/AR is being used in the healthcare today and how this technology is expected to affect the healthcare sector in the future.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Stay up to date on the industry's big players in the VR/AR industry and where they sit in the value chain.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Identify emerging industry trends to gain a competitive advantage.</p></bodyText></listItem></list></p><p>Key Topics Covered                   1 Industry Players2 Industry Trends2.1 Healthcare Use Case Themes2.2 Macroeconomic Themes2.3 Technology Themes2.4 Regulatory Themes3 Industry Analysisy3.1 Market Size and Growth Forecasts3.2 Unmet Needs3.3 Market Drivers3.4 Market Barriers3.5 Mergers, Acquisitions &amp; Partnerships3.6 Timeline3.7 Healthcare Case Studies4 Value Chain4.1 Device Layer4.2 Application Layer5 Companies Section5.1 Tech Companies: Headsets/Smart Glasses5.2 Companies: Healthcare Applications6 Glossary             For more information         about this  report  visit <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/yjb2sy\">https://www.researchandmarkets.com/r/yjb2sy</url></p><p>         Research and Markets also offers Custom Research services providing focused, comprehensive and tailored research.     </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/> CONTACT: ResearchAndMarkets.com          Laura Wood, Senior Press Manager          <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:press@researchandmarkets.com\">press@researchandmarkets.com</email>          For E.S.T Office Hours Call 1-917-300-0470          For U.S./CAN Toll Free Call 1-800-526-8630          For GMT Office Hours Call +353-1-416-8900 </p></bodyText></contact></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PRIZNE-7812471</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PRIZNE2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5V-BTG1-DY2R-40S8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222091</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><timeReceived>6:48 AM PT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 GlobeNewswire, Inc.

Ann Wagner said Friday that human trafficking \"is hiding in plain sight,\" and she predicted a showdown with the tech industry over her efforts to restrict advertising of the sex trade on the internet.</p><p>\"Sex trafficking is slavery,\" she told the Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition conference here. \"It is the indignity and the humiliation of repeated rape, the destruction of a future and a life, a precious life of God's.\"</p><p>The Faith &amp; Freedom Coalition was founded by Ralph Reed, an acolyte of televangelist Pat Robertson and political leader of the Christian Coalition, which had great sway over the Republican Party in the 1990s.</p><p>Wagner, R-Ballwin, was introduced as a leader in the fight against human trafficking and the child sex trade. She made a pitch for support for a bill she introduced in April that would amend federal telecommunications law to restrict advertising of sex on the internet.</p><p>Federal law now says that \"no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"</p><p>Wagner's attempts to change it have met with resistance on First Amendment grounds and from what she described as \"big tech.\"</p><p>She said Missouri law provided an example of a \"twisted world\" in which \"sexual exploitation of a child is a felony but sexual exploitation of a child in the commercial sex industry is only a misdemeanor.\"</p><p>Her appeal to this evangelical-political group was heavily cloaked in religious language.</p><p>Quoting Frederick Douglass, she said: \"One and God make a majority. Our God is a just God and justice will prevail.\"</p><p>President Donald Trump spoke to the same group on Thursday, at the same time that FBI Director James Comey's dramatic testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.</p><p>\"As you know, we're under siege,\" Trump told the religious conservatives. \"You understand that. But we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever - you watch.\"</p><p>On Friday, the audience got conflicting worldviews on the shape of Trump and the conservative movement.</p><p>\"We are winning,\" Americans for Tax Reform Chairman Grover Norquist said. \"The other team can be distracting, but we are winning.\"</p><p>He pointed to the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court and Trump's systematic rollback of regulations. At the Federal Communications Commission, Norquist said, \"we now have the majority there that is deregulating 16 percent of the U.S. economy.\"</p><p>Trump senior adviser Kellyanne Conway appeared after Wagner and talked extensively about how her Christian faith sustains her. In a discussion with Reed, she said she believed one reason Trump won in 2016 was that at the final debate he parried Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton's charges that he was an extremist for opposing abortion.</p><p>Reed said that \"that was a huge moment\" for evangelicals and Catholics, and a key to Trump's victory.</p><p>Reed asked Conway about reports that Trump had surrounded himself with yes people and did not freely take advice.</p><p>\"That that is just not true, and frankly the men and women I serve with, if we did not feel if our opinions or our recommendations didn't matter, why would we be there?\" Conway replied.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> In this June 9, 2017 photograph, Rep.

Yarvin was using COVID-19 as a news hook to push the long-term strategic goal, common among a curious new subset of conservatives, to \"refute internationalism\" and replace it with an \"isolationist vision.\" Imagine a world, he mused, \"where travel between hemispheres is cut off next week--and stays cut off for years, decades, centuries.... Would this be a disaster? No--it would actually be fine.\" After all, Yarvin averred in a trollishly insincere pivot, unmolested global wandering destroyed the vibrant cultures of the mysterious Far East, reducing their unique citadels to just more tawdry simulacra of Boston.</p><p>Who is Curtis Yarvin, and what was this atavistic assertion doing under the aegis of Claremont, a staid conservative institution founded by disciples of the late political philosopher Harry Jaffa? The Claremont Review of Books, for most of its two-decade run, has been a polite repository for intellectual conservatism. Jaffa, for his part, had defended the legacy of Abraham Lincoln to many then-skeptical fellow conservatives while elevating the equality of man to near-mystical primacy in the American founding.</p><p>Claremont's web journal The American Mind, though, was launched in 2018 with a more provocative agenda: to \"rethink the ideological framework of the American Right.\" The animating idea, founding editor Matthew Peterson explains, is that traditional right-of-center groups are out of touch: They don't even realize that their own staffs include \"people under 35\" who \"fundamentally disagree with supposedly fundamental [classical liberal] tenets of their organization. No one wants to hear or deal with it. They want to stick their heads in the sand.\" A vibrant and ideologically adventurous new conservative movement, Peterson says, is \"bubbling beneath the surface, or even online all over the place. We are not supposed to talk about these things or engage that movement?\"</p><p>Yarvin is perhaps better known for the pen name under which he rose to internet fame in the late 2000s and early 2010s: \"Mencius Moldbug.\" At his Unqualified Reservations blog, Moldbug, a software entrepreneur by day, unspooled head-spinningly long-winded \"neoreactionary\" screeds, wielding a broadsword of abandoned pre-Enlightenment wisdom against the squalid lies of equality, democracy, and the smothering tyranny of what he called the communist-progressive \"Cathedral.\" Back then, the Cathedral ruled the discourse so totally and viciously that it wasn't prudent--perhaps wasn't even safe--to burden Moldbug's true identity with his brutally honest thoughts. But Tech-Crunch outed Moldbug as Yarvin in 2013, and in the Trump era he seems happy enough to publicly be himself.</p><p>Yarvin, a follower of the 19th century British polemicist Thomas Carlyle, is the type of outside-the-box thinker who argues that monarchy is inherently better than democracy, that street crime is more of a danger to his readers' lives than all of government's depredations, and that one of the worst sins of modernity is that people refuse to speak candidly about IQ differences across human types. Such notions are by no means new to the American right, but they feel fresh again in 2020 not only because libertarianism has made some inroads against conservative traditionalism over the last few decades but also because Yarvin's extreme anti-cosmopolitanism comes with a genuinely modern twist: He is connected, via friendship, venture capital, and at least some ideological affinity, with one of America's wealthiest and most controversial men, the tech tycoon Peter Thiel.</p><p>Thiel, whom the George Mason economist Tyler Cowen in 2019 called \"the most influential conservative intellectual with other conservative and libertarian intellectuals,\" is co-founder of PayPal, the big data analytics firm Palantir Technologies, and the trailblazing venture capital group Founders Fund. The latter entity has funded Yarvin's software company Tlon, the company's CEO, Galen Wolfe-Pauly, told The Verge in 2017. Yarvin and Thiel watched the 2016 election results together, according to a BuzzFeed-obtained email exchange between Yarvin and alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.</p><p>\"Peter needs guidance on politics for sure,\" Yiannopoulos posited in one of the messages.</p><p>\"Less than you might think!\" Yarvin responded. \"He's fully enlightened, just plays it very carefully.\"</p><p>Both Thiel and Yarvin trace the ruination of our tech, education, and governing culture to the dominance of progressive political correctness. Associates of Thiel say the financier does not consider himself \"neoreactionary,\" though he did write as far back as 2009 that \"I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.\" That was the same year Yarvin, as Moldbug, wrote that \"socialism and fascism produce a mix of substandard and disastrous results, for a simple reason: both originate in democracy, a precancerous growth always pregnant with some malignancy.\"</p><p>Prior to Donald Trump's presidential campaign, Thiel moved through the 21st century like a mysterious science fiction wizard of finance. He was, among other things, the first key outside investor in Facebook (a company on whose board he remains, albeit as a kind of loyal opposition), and he has pumped his V.C. winnings into such colorfully contrarian projects as private space travel, new floating countries, and the quest for human immortality. He paid for the lawsuit that bankrupted the web tabloid Gawker, encouraged kids to drop out of college by offering them prizes via his Thiel Fellowship program, and argued that the ultimate entrepreneurial goal was to create and control a monopoly. In short, he made himself the patron saint of the kind of libertarian-adjacent intellectual exercises that most normies find obscure and sometimes alarming.</p><p>Since striding on stage at the 2016 Republican National Convention to tout Trump as an agent for reversing American decline, though, Thiel and his ideas have graduated from the ideological margins to the vanguard of 21st century conservatism. He is now the wealthiest ally, if not quite the most generous funder, of the new conservative nationalist movement, becoming that rare radical right-winger whose dinner parties are covered by the establishment scorekeepers at Vanity Fair.</p><p>Sources within the national conservative space say they see no signs Thiel intends to become a financier, in the mode of Charles Koch or George Soros, of the new nationalist conservatism as a political cause. But the fact that the often-reticent Thiel has taken to speaking at national conservative conferences and writing gnomic essays in the Christian traditionalist journal First Things may say more about the depth of his engagement than does his check writing.</p><p>This new ferment involving and surrounding Thiel (a man who still occasionally refers to himself as libertarian) shows that ideas libertarians once thought were reasonably and blessedly settled on the right--that industrial subsidies and high tariffs make the world poorer while giving too much power to corrupt and inefficient governments, say, or even that people shouldn't be sentenced to forever reside on whatever land mass they happened to be born on--are now up for grabs.</p><p>WHAT DOES THIEL WANT?</p><p>THROUGH HIS OVERLAPPING social and intellectual worlds of venture capital, goal-oriented philanthropy, and Overton window-moving conservatism, Thiel has helped create a kind of rolling debate society in which entrepreneurs and technologists trade ideas with politicians and theorists. This \"Thielosphere,\" says Patri Friedman, is \"more willing to engage with deliberately transgressive ideas\" than are most groups aiming for concrete power and influence in America.</p><p>Friedman, son of anarcho-capitalist David and grandson of Nobelist Milton, established the Thiel-funded Seasteading Institute in 2008 to develop the concept of sovereign seaborne micro-competitors to the nation-state. Yet he happily coexists in the Thielite ecosystem with such aggressively nationalist politicians as Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), to whom Thiel has donated. The key, Friedman says, is that the thinkers and doers surrounding Thiel don't tend to be yes men, and the loose group conversation tends to \"grapple with [ideas] in different ways,\" with participants getting \"value in parts even if they don't agree with all the goals.\"</p><p>So what are Thiel's ideological goals? The billionaire took the opportunity to sum up his views at the July 2019 National Conservatism Conference in Washington, D.C., organized by new nationalist founding father Yoram Hazony under the auspices of a freshly launched group, the Edmund Burke Foundation. It is striking that Thiel chose that otherwise inauspicious venue to speak, which again demonstrates that he has made a priority of engaging with this new ideology.</p><p>In his hourlong presentation, Thiel expressed no particular libertarian inclinations. Instead, he talked about how public policy decisions should be based on how they would better not individual lives but a collective \"America\" while crushing her enemies. These latter foes he named as Google, China, and the U.S. university system, advocating vigorous police actions against the first and third and a trade war (at the least) against the Middle Kingdom.</p><p>Universities, Thiel said, are spreading the virus of \"cultural Marxism\" while perpetrating criminal fraud by shackling students with debt that the institutions themselves should be forced to repay. (He's been railing against political correctness on campus since his days as co-founder of the right-wing student newspaper The Stanford Review in 1987.)</p><p>Silicon Valley, too, is trying to impose a monoculture of identity politics on an unwilling America, he said. Google's collaborations with Red China on artificial intelligence merit scrutiny from the CIA and FBI, who should ask executives \"in a not excessively gentle manner\" about their \"seemingly treasonous\" behavior. The day Thiel gave that speech, July 16, 2019, Trump tweeted regarding Google's supposed treason: \"The Trump Administration will take a look!\"</p><p>Meanwhile, Thiel said, tariffs of 25 percent on Chinese products, negotiated by representatives untainted by free trade dogma, would be a good opening bid.</p><p>It's true that China is sinisterly authoritarian, makes for a difficult trading partner, and stretches its prerogatives in and around Asia. But the new conservative nationalists have no well-developed theory of how industrial policy will succeed in hobbling China and no prudent theory of how to fight one of our largest tradingpartners and debt holders without costs that far overwhelm any imagined benefits.</p><p>The dog that never barked in Thiel's long disquisition on national conservatism was any concern about government size, scope, or spending. Nor was there any nod toward the moral value and material fecundity of free markets.</p><p>In other contexts, Thiel has said he'd like to see the U.S. be more of a low-tax business haven, attacked NIMBY (\"not in my backyard\") urban planning and zoning for jacking up the cost of housing, and expressed general scorn about the effectiveness of government. But with Trump as the great disruptor, Thiel is making the bet that a more nationalistic state can outperform its equally sized or even smaller antecedents, managed as those were by politically correct globalists.</p><p>WHO DOES THIEL LEARN FROM?</p><p>\"THE WHOLE ISSUE of human violence,\" Thiel wrote in a 2004 essay collected in a book titled Politics and Apocalypse, \"has been whitewashed away by the Enlightenment.\" The 9/11 terrorist attacks, he argued, demonstrated the West's urgent need \"to awaken from that very long and profitable period of intellectual slumber and amnesia that is so misleadingly called the Enlightenment,\" whose \"easy bromides have become deadly falsehoods in our time.\" Thiel's essay was titled \"The Straussian Moment,\" in reference to Leo Strauss, best known in the 21st century for his ideas about how philosophers have never felt free to openly speak their real truths. But the main thrust of Thiel's argument was channeling Carl Schmitt.</p><p>Who was Schmitt? An internationally influential German political philosopher who defended the notion of dictatorship over the more flabby bureaucratic state well into the 1940s.</p><p>\"The high point of politics are the moments in which the enemy is, in concrete clarity, recognized as the enemy,\" wrote Thiel, quoting Schmitt, in his essay. He would later assign the philosopher to a class he taught at Stanford in 2019.</p><p>Schmitt was obsessed with how political communities unify in relation to enemies and with the idea that a singular, independent executive is best suited to dealing with threats. If a bloc within a given political community \"declares that it no longer recognized enemies,\" Thiel quoted Schmitt as saying, then \"it joins their side and aids them.\" On the wilder edges of the new nationalist conservatism, libertarians are seen as precisely such quislings in the eternal war with the left.</p><p>Written during the George W. Bush administration--a time when governing neoconservatives were employing Straussian arguments to justify an ever-expansive notion of executive power--the essay lamented that \"a direct path forward is prevented by America's constitutional machinery\" and that no \"single ambitious person\" can \"reconstruct...the old republic.\"</p><p>Especially close to Thiel's heart is his old Stanford professor, the French literary critic and Catholic philosopher Rene Girard, \"the one writer who has influenced me the most,\" as Thiel has described him. The billionaire in 2007 co-founded with Girard an institute to promote Girardism called Imitatio.</p><p>What is Girardism, precisely? The philosopher pushed a complicated set of notions about our inescapable desire to imitate others--what he termed \"mimetic\" tendencies. But his oeuvre is also purposely obscurantist, with an emphasis on the importance to human history of ritual violence and an intimation that a full understanding of his insights would upend the order of the world.</p><p>Mimetic theory tells us that the things we we want and love and fight for (and against) are not authentic to us but rather handed down by our parents and absorbed from our communities. Thiel says Girard cured him of a naively individualistic early libertarianism by teaching him how our very sense of being is irreducibly social.</p><p>One crucial Girard insight that you can see the new nationalism's keyboard warriors embody on a daily basis is that opposing tribes are drawn like moths to the flame of an ever-escalating battle. As Girard scholar Cynthia L. Haven put it in a December 2019 essay in Church Life Journal, \"moral indignation so often leads us to echo and amplify the very behavior that triggered the indignation\" in the first place. \"The greater the expression of outrage, the less likely it will lead to any real change, and the more likely it will lead [to] violence,\" Haven wrote. \"Bystanders are drawn into 'taking sides,' in mimetic conformity with admired friends, neighbors, and colleagues. Thus the conflict can envelop a whole society, with cycles of retaliatory (and therefore imitative) violence and one-upsmanship.\"</p><p>Girard, then, saw Twitter's soul before it existed. His theory of mimetic desire leads to an important point: The national conservative covets the progressive's cultural power, while the progressive lusts after the national conservative's political power in the age of Trump.</p><p>Some seeming paradoxes in Thiel's corporate actions and political concerns can be usefully interpreted through a Girardian lens. Thiel in 2003 co-founded a company called Palantir, whose board he still chairs. It was seed-funded by an offshoot of the CIA and marshals the forces of big data and artificial intelligence in the solving of large problems, often at the behest of both foreign and domestic law enforcement.</p><p>Could there be something, shall we say, mimetic about how a man so fiercely critical of Google's collaboration with China can turn around and help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) track and deport illegal immigrants? Thiel is fond of lamenting the \"eye of Sauron\" aspects of technomodernity as a tool of the repressive modern state, a \"Chinese Communist A.I.\" Yet in important ways he emulates the very Chinese he despises. After 200 Palantir employees wrote a letter of concern about the company's collaboration with ICE, co-founder and CEO Alex Karp snapped back that the company was not about to tell \"the average American\" that \"I will not support your defense needs.\"</p><p>One of Thiel's most famous tech-contrarian quips is that \"we wanted flying cars; instead we got 140 characters.\" Yet his business interests skew toward companies dedicated to data analytics, financial services, management, security, and social networking rather than moonshot futuristic changes in the physical world. On the spectrum of flying cars to Twitter, his investments are significantly closer to the latter.</p><p>THIS IS WAR</p><p>THE AMERICAN RIGHT once aspired to limit government and unleash the free market. Now, with encouragement from Thiel, it increasingly seeks to unleash government and limit the free market. What explains such ideological whiplash?</p><p>Part of it \"is just the need to engage with existing political systems in order to accomplish actual change,\" Friedman says in an email. But also, times have changed.</p><p>\"In a well functioning 'liberal' (enlightenment values, not libertarian) society, as we had in the '80s &amp; '90s, pushing for more freedom makes sense. But when there are paramilitary extremist groups fighting in the streets,\" Friedman continues, referring to groups such as antifa and their right-wing street-fighting foes, \"that lack of basic civil harmony seems like a bigger problem than government spending.\" He thinks Thiel \"would point to things like leftist bias in universities, low interest rates, technological stagnation, as being more problematic in 2020\" than taxes and regulation.</p><p>Thiel, who moved his operations from the Bay Area to Los Angeles in part to escape the ideological conformity of Silicon Valley, seems to view lefty political correctness as both a trivial distraction from grave matters of import and an active menace to be urgently confronted. \"Until the left is able to move beyond identity politics,\" he said in a 2019 Manhattan Institute lecture, \"it's not going to be able to focus on the scale that we need to be focusing on for this country.\"</p><p>So what are the new nationalists focusing on? Big-heave manifestos calling to empower the state and attack the woke left and its Big Tech enablers. In December 2019, a group of thinkers from The American Mind, The American Conservative, American Renewal, Human Events, and First Things jointly proposed a \"Tech New Deal\" to bring increased government oversight and management to U.S. technology companies in the name of \"American greatness.\"</p><p>\"The turbulence of the Trump administration has cleared away old conceptual brush and made room for clear-eyed perceptions of the world as it is, not as fanatics imagine it should be,\" the manifestoists proclaimed. The real fanatics, to them, are those who don't understand that the nation must forcibly harness innovation to \"serve human ends.\" The essay makes a sly nod toward Thiel himself, noting that only \"billionaires\" have the nerve to oppose \"the creepiest transhumanists and posthumanists\" in tech or to admit that \"in the name of economic growth, human life is being diminished.\"</p><p>The document, like so much of the new-nationalist ferment, is shot through with hostility toward progressive political correctness. \"We must strengthen safeguards against the use of tech power to establish a radical secular religion within America's public institutions,\" the writers advocated, demanding punishment for private social media companies that censor conservative or traditionalist viewpoints. \"As important as deplatforming the worst of moral degenerates may be, our free democracy depends even more on ensuring Americans can openly deliberate foundational questions, from the significance of citizenship to the biology of sexual differences.\"</p><p>As that last comment illustrates, the Thielosphere devotes significant time and emotional energy to fighting for the ability to say things that offend the sensibilities of progressives. In practice, that means controversy-courting observations involving race, immigration, gender, and the like.</p><p>Eric Weinstein, the managing director of Thiel's personal investment firm, Thiel Capital, coined the term \"intellectual dark web\" to refer to opinion slingers uncowed by the prevailing orthodoxies (and, as a result, frequently shunned by mainstream and elite institutions). As Thiel once said, \"it's so important for me to have environments in which people who don't agree on things, but agree on what constitutes a conversation, can sit down with an idea [and] that nobody's going to leave the table with their reputation in tatters to the extent that they can't find a job on Monday to support themselves.\"</p><p>THE EDGES OF NATIONAL CONSERVATISM</p><p>LIBERTARIANS GENERALLY AGREE with the new nationalists that the parameters for what is considered acceptable debate should be expansive. They just don't want to use government as a crowbar toward that end, nor do they take the same transgressive delight in making negative collective judgments about entire population blocs--very often segments of the population that have been historically discriminated against.</p><p>In The American Mind last year, one loud new voice complained that too many cowed conservatives \"are fanatical believers in the public religion of the regime--they've internalized 'antiracism,' hysteria about 'anti-Semitism,' and similar taboos....They are regime toadies and kapos, much like the journalists attacking me.\" So wrote a pseudonymous shock jock known as \"Bronze Age Pervert,\" or BAP for short, under the once-sober auspices of the Claremont Institute.</p><p>BAP's self-published book, Bronze Age Mindset, was reviewed respectfully and at length in The Claremont Review of Books by Michael Anton, a former Trump administration official most famous for penning a then-pseudonymous 2016 essay in that same publication, \"The Flight 93 Election,\" which analogized a Hillary Clinton presidency to \"Russian Roulette with a semi-auto.\" Bronze Age Mindset had been gifted to Anton by none other than Thiel's pal Curtis Yarvin.</p><p>That secondhand link does not, of course, mean BAP necessarily shares ideas with Thiel. Far from it. But Anton's choice to establish the chain of custody endows the Pervert's transgressive wildness with a semi-respectable pedigree. Even if Thiel himself wouldn't go where BAP dares to tread, Anton and others seek to connect the latter's thought to their new form of conservatism, one that is totally unmoored from any connection to libertarian principles.</p><p>\"Tax cuts, deregulation, trade giveaways, Russophobia, democracy wars, and open borders are not, to say the least, getting the kids riled up,\" Anton wrote in his review. So what's quickening youthful pulses these days, according to BAP? Apparently, \"teenage put-downs,\" \"crude sexual or scatological slang,\" and \"sweeping generalizations about women, homosexuals, and, to a lesser extent, national and ethnic groups.\"</p><p>Anton squinted hard enough to see the virtues of such anti-Enlightenment conservatism. \"On reflection, I came to believe that some of the ridiculousness is intended to help the unscientific and unphilosophic grasp concepts beyond their conceptual framework,\" he wrote, echoing some of the mysticism that surrounds Girard. \"And a great deal of BAP's silly outrageousness seems to be there to provide air cover for the outrageous things he means in deadly earnest.\"</p><p>In a response essay in The American Mind, BAP insisted that he is indeed earnest about (among other things) bringing \"unvarnished, unedited Nietzscheanism\" to U.S. politics, defending whites against the \"violent racial hatred\" of the left, and lamenting \"the religion of our time...unquestioned and absolute worship of human equality.\" Suck it, Harry Jaffa!</p><p>The Pervert is little more than a long-winded, reactionary, Jack Kerouac/Hunter S. Thompson-style materialist atheist who justifies his drunken revels in the Far East's fleshpots with a pseudoscientific celebration of hormonal vitalism and argues that \"the peoples that have arisen out of nature must be preserved in their distinct forms.\" His game is to gin up enthusiasm among aimless, underemployed young men using a brew of physical bravado and passionate resentments. It all reads as fascist, and deliberately so. Of course, in the meme age, you are the sucker for letting such things troll you--even if what you're repulsed by is exactly what you think it is.</p><p>There's something both desperate and decadent about a respected intellectual institution giving considered attention to a work containing such one-liners as \"At Masada and at other times the Jews killed their own children to escape subjection, when they were still a noble people\" and \"Imagine lesbian mulatta commissars with young Martin Sheen face and haircut manning the future Bergen-Belsens, installations that will span tens of miles.\" But hey, the international elites have failed us, the woke left keeps marching on, and at least the Pervert is learned--he quotes Carl Schmitt, after all.</p><p>We might never fully understand what Peter Thiel, or the new nationalist conservatives, really want. But to the extent they claim to be defending \"the West,\" attacking the Enlightenment is an odd way to go about it. Claremont's embrace of BAP and Yarvin, and its publication of government-aggrandizing manifestos about the need to shackle the tech industry for the national good, should serve as fair warning to libertarians that principles such as free trade, equal rights, and drug legalization are considered boring \"Cathedral\" ideas on the hip new right. It's more thrilling to make ordinary people mad by flirting openly with racism and fantasizing out loud about political violence. Libertarians, clinging to their no-longer-cutting-edge preferences for toleration and the minimization of force, will no doubt shiver seeing the likes of Claremont Institute President Ryan P. Williams writing that Americans are stuck in a \"cold civil war\" in which one side or the other must win \"decisive and conclusive political victory.\"</p><p>On the front lines of this cold civil war are rhetorical warriors in the mold of Bronze Age Pervert (though they're more likely to be Christian than to openly embrace his paganism), exuding an extrapolitical disgust with progressive freaks and their decadence, their tattoos and their obesity, their transgenderism and their whining about the sins of the West, their porn and their just plain weakness. The New Right that Claremont is promoting is consciously grooming a young generation to obsess over how the dominant mores of post-1960s liberalism have failed them.</p><p>IMMANENTIZING THE ESCHATON</p><p>GENERATING HUMAN FLOURISHING is hard, as is changing the culture around you via the state. Knowing that, Thiel has long favored visionary and experimental proposals for enacting change through a variety of novel mechanisms. But of late his engagement on that question has generated strange bedfellows.</p><p>Fifty years ago a generation looked at the dominant traditional mores, found they left many people distressed and dissatisfied, and advocated loosening them. Now a generation growing up under a new dominant set of mores has also--surprise--found they leave many people distressed and dissatisfied. Conservatives used to understand that one cannot and should not try to use government power to \"immanentize the eschaton\"--to bring about heaven on Earth. That was a heresy only communists believed in. Much of the new nationalist conservatism has forgotten this central insight, seeking instead to sic the state on everything that feels wrong about the economy and the culture alike.</p><p>Only a genuine, principles-based, rights-oriented classical liberalism--one that understands that your side can't always control every relevant citadel of social or intellectual power-can enable the republic, however imperfectly, to continue flourishing. An ever-escalating politics of hostility, as Schmitt's intellectual opponent F.A. Hayek recognized, places that noble project in jeopardy, because it threatens \"the self-ordering forces of society and the role of law [as] an ordering mechanism.\"</p><p>A conservatism influenced by the likes of Girard or Schmitt can quickly turn into a danger to civic peace and to the republic itself. The choice to engage in a mimetic war with the opposing team's devils--whether over belief or comportment or ethnicity--can become a self-fulfilling Manichean prophecy.</p><p>Senior Editor BRIAN DOHERTY is the author of four books, including Radicals for Capitalism: A Freewheeling History of the Modern American Libertarian Movement (PublicAffairs).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-629606154</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 629606154</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60CH-7SH1-DYTM-9145-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4926\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Reason Foundation</copyright><publicationName>Reason</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0048-6906</issn><volume>Vol. 52</volume><issueNumber>No. 4\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 1, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Humanities</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Philosophy and religion</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Political science</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Electronic periodicals</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Security</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjQ2QjVCNUE0MTUzNDcxNzgxNjk3ODkwNzE0RkJDQTU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzgyNTlGMzg1QkU1NEY0MEE0Mzc3ODk0N0M2MDY1RTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYBP</classCode><className>CONSERVATISM</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813940MM</classCode><className>POLITICAL PARTIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp;

India has a population of 1.3bn, half of whom are under 25; smartphone penetration is just 35pc; and there is no chance of a fixed-line network ever being built to service the country's internet needs.

I want to thank Chairman Simons and Commissioners Phillips, Wilson, Chopra, and Slaughter for being here. I am glad to see the five of you here again after our productive conversation last summer before this subcommittee.</p><p>The Federal Trade Commission is tasked with broad and important responsibilities and its jurisdiction spreads out over almost every aspect of the U.S. economy from large, household-named technology companies in Silicon Valley to small mom-and-pop shops in rural America.</p><p>But, recently, concerns surrounding data security and data privacy, including questions about what information is collected, how companies use that information, who that information is shared with, and what protections exist for consumers, have demanded more Congressional attention.</p><p>Last Congress, this Committee held high profile hearings around incidents involving data security and data privacy issues with the CEOs of Equifax, Facebook, and Twitter. We also held hearings focused on: securing consumer information; understanding algorithmic decision making; exploring the online advertisement ecosystem and how it operates; and an oversight hearing with you, the FTC.</p><p>Privacy was a premiere issue during these hearings. But as we learned, this is a tough issue; privacy does not mean the exact same thing to every American.</p><p>I want to echo the sentiments of my colleague Rep. Rodgers who outlined the vast benefits consumers get from the use of their information online. We cannot lose sight of the tremendous benefits consumers get from the use of data access to top-tier journalism, affordable and quickly delivered products, telehealth and research initiatives, and much more.</p><p>Here in the U.S., we have a thriving startup ecosystem and a regulatory environment that enables small businesses to grow and compete, in no small part because of the free flow of information. And, as a result, companies innovate, create new jobs, and offer consumers options and convenience.</p><p>I believe it is important that we work together toward a bipartisan federal privacy bill. And we are ready and willing to tackle crafting such a bill. I hope that we can continue down the bipartisan path together.</p><p>A federal privacy bill must set one national standard. Allowing a patchwork of state laws will not only hurt innovation and small businesses but will limit consumers options online. Consumers expect a seamless online experience, and I do not want to see that taken away.</p><p>We must protect innovation and small businesses. We should learn from Europe where large companies are only getting larger and small companies are only getting smaller. JPMorgan Chase and Co. CEO Jamie Dimon recently said Dodd-Frank created a moat around his company which is exactly what we risk doing with the likes of Google and Facebook if we do not carefully craft a national privacy bill.</p><p>We must enhance security for consumers. Companies must have reasonable practices in place to protect consumer information.</p><p>We must increase transparency consumers deserve to know how their information is collected, used, and shared.</p><p>And we must improve accountability. When companies fail to keep their promises or outright misuse consumer information, those companies must be held accountable. This goes to the heart of the enforcement issues.</p><p>The FTC accomplishes its consumer protection mission through law enforcement by bringing actions against companies who engage in unfair or deceptive acts or practices; through advocacy; and through consumer and business education efforts. The FTC can file injunctions, levy civil penalties, and can seek remedies on behalf of consumers to redress their harms.</p><p>The FTC generally operates as a highly effective bipartisan agency. Returning millions directly to consumers after they are defrauded, and I look forward to hearing an update on those efforts. I also look forward to hearing about the consumer protection hearings and what the agency has learned about privacy harms and risks.</p><p>Every agency has challenges, and recent court cases have changed the direction of some agency activity to refocus on due process. I am encouraged that these types of improvements would help small businesses understand their rights when faced with the full force of the FTC.</p><p>I believe the FTC is the right agency to enforce a new privacy law with appropriate safeguards and process improvements to ensure strong, consistent enforcement. Some have suggested that the quick answer is more money, more rulemaking authority, and more employees. There is no quick fix. I would like to hear from the Chairman about his views on unbounded rulemaking for the FTC, and whether the agency can compete for talent with the big tech firms moving to the DC area. We must consider market realities and ask if there is a more effective way to get experts to the FTC for unique cases.</p><p>I look forward to hearing from you all about how you are thinking of using the current tools at the FTC to address privacy concerns in our digital world.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>###</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SNS-1122909678</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SNS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W2P-GDN1-DYTH-G061-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8058</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"911\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 States News Service</copyright><publicationName>States News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 8, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

And in the process, they have hurt small businesses and stifled innovation,\" Warren wrote in a post <url normalizedValue=\"https://medium.com\">https://medium.com</url> /@teamwarren/heres-how-we-can-break-up-big-tech-9ad9e0da324c on Medium.</p><p>Warren said she would nominate regulators who would unwind acquisitions such as Facebook's deals for WhatsApp and Instagram, Amazon's deals for Whole Foods and Zappos, and Google's purchases of Waze, Nest and DoubleClick.</p><p>Investors shrugged off her comments. Shares of Facebook closed up 0.3 percent on Friday, while Alphabet fell 0.08 percent and Amazon.com lost 0.3 percent.</p><p>It is rare for the government to seek to undo a consummated deal.</p><p>The most famous case in recent memory is the government's effort to break up Microsoft. The Justice Department won a preliminary victory in 2000 but was reversed on appeal. The case settled with Microsoft intact.</p><p>Warren also proposed legislation that would require tech companies like Google and Amazon that offer an online marketplace or exchange to refrain from competing on their own platform. This would, for example, forbid Amazon itself from selling on its Amazon Marketplace platform.</p><p>Amazon and Google did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Facebook declined comment.</p><p>\"AN ARCHAIC IDEA\"</p><p>Tech companies have come under fire because of their role in displacing existing businesses. Amazon has replaced many brick-and-mortar stores and has been criticized for poorly paying its warehouse workers.</p><p>Facebook has angered lawmakers for losing track of users' data and for not doing more to stop foreign meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Google has clashed with smaller companies, like Yelp, over search placements and has raised concerns it would comply with China's internet censorship and surveillance policies if it re-enters the Asian nation's search engine market.</p><p>Congress held a series of hearings last year looking at the dominance of major tech companies.</p><p>NetChoice, an e-commerce trade group whose members include Facebook and Google, said Warren's plan would lead to higher prices.</p><p>\"Senator Warren is wrong in her assertion that tech markets lack competition. Never before have consumers and workers had more access to goods, services and opportunities online,\" said Carl Szabo, vice president and general counsel for NetChoice.</p><p>In Washington, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, said breaking up the big tech companies would \"take us back to the Stone Age.\"</p><p>\"This is not a vision for the future, but an archaic idea that should be dumped in your computer trash can,\" he said.</p><p>Public Knowledge, a tech policy group, called Warren's plan a step toward protecting the next generation of businesses, but stopped short of a full-throated support for breaking up the tech giants.</p><p>\"We need legislation specifically targeted to enhance competition on digital platforms so that there is a real opportunity for new, innovative competitors to succeed,\" said Charlotte Slaiman, the group's policy counsel.</p><p>Tim Wu, a professor of law, science and technology at Columbia Law School who coined the term \"net neutrality\" and has warned against an economy dominated by a few giant firms, said in a tweet that it was \"heartening\" to see the idea of breaking up the tech giants gaining some traction.</p><p>Tech companies are some of the biggest political donors. Google spent $21 million to lobby in 2018 while Amazon spent $14.2 million and Facebook spent $12.62 million, according to their filings to U.S. Congress.</p><p>Angering a deep-pocketed industry could hurt Democrats, but that is not likely to be a big worry for Warren, who made her political mark and plenty of enemies by going after big banks after the 2007-09 financial crisis. In the Senate, Warren continues to be an outspoken critic of Wall Street and is a leader of her party's progressive wing.</p><p>Other Democratic candidates have also criticized the tech firms.</p><p>Senator Amy Klobuchar used her campaign launch speech to vow action on digital issues like privacy, saying \"big tech companies\" misuse personal data.</p><p>Senator Bernie Sanders, another presidential candidate, in 2018 even named a bill after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the Stop BEZOS Act, which would tax big companies if their employees receive public benefits.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">JPCOME-139792594</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">JPCOME2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VKP-3JJ1-F11P-X4R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">411390</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Jerusalem Post.

Major indexes fell to session lows after U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell decided to put off a planned vote on a bill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act until after the Senate's July 4 recess. The healthcare legislation, which has encountered resistance from several Republicans, is the first plank of Trump's domestic policy agenda, with investors eager for him to move onto his other plans including tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation. </p><p>Promises for such domestic polices helped fuel a 13.5 percent rise for the benchmark S&amp;P 500 since Trump's Nov 8 election.   The market likes certainty, and now there  s uncertainty,\" said Peter Costa, president of trading firm Empire Executions in New York. \"What is this going to look like when this gets out of the next iteration? That uncertainty I think is just having people pause a little bit.\" \"I also think that when the market gets to certain levels, any type of uncertainty, especially in anything that has to do with the administration, will have an adverse effect,\" Costa said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 33.16 points, or 0.15 percent, to 21,376.39, the S&amp;P 500 lost 9.69 points, or 0.40 percent, to 2,429.38 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 65.14 points, or 1.04 percent, to 6,182.01. Big tech names weighed most heavily on the S&amp;P 500. Google parent Alphabet fell 1.8 percent after EU antitrust regulators hit the tech giant with a record US$2.7 billion fine. The tech sector , which has led the market's gains this year, pulled back 1.1 percent. The healthcare sector weakened after news of the vote delay, and was off 0.5 percent. Financials were the best performing group, rising 0.9 percent. Data showed consumer confidence for June rose more than expected, which could bolster the Fed's case for another rate hike this year. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said the Fed rightly plans to raise rates once more this year, given recent inflation weakness is likely temporary. U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said she does not believe that there will be a run on the banking system at least as long as she lives. Investors are gearing up for second-quarter corporate earnings season, after a strong first quarter. \"On an earnings basis, the market appears to be fully valued and we need to see fiscal policy, tax and regulatory reform, to drive GDP growth and then stock prices,\" said Ernie Cecilia, chief investment officer of Bryn Mawr Trust in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.37-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.43-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

In subdued holiday trading, the S&amp;P 500 declined for a third consecutive session. But the benchmark index still tallied an annual gain of 9.5 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 13.4 percent for 2016, even as it recorded its first weekly decline since the U.S. election on Nov. </p><p>8. Stocks stalled this week after surging in the wake of Donald Trump's presidential election. Investors have bet Trump will cut taxes and regulations and introduce fresh economic stimulus. \"It  s been such a significant run-up that there  s been a pause,\" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&amp;T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. \"We are to the point now where there  s uncertainty with regard to what policies are implemented, when are they implemented and how are they going to affect the economy as a whole and industries specifically.\" The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 57.18 points, or 0.29 percent, to 19,762.6, the S&amp;P 500 lost 10.43 points, or 0.46 percent, to 2,238.83 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 48.97 points, or 0.9 percent, to 5,383.12. The Dow slipped further from the 20,000 milestone, after coming within 13 points of the mark but not yet breaching it. The Dow is now up about 8 percent since the election. \"It  s been quite a rally, so not surprised to see some profit taking,\" said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer with Solaris Asset Management in New York. \"There might be some reality setting in that a lot of this rally is based on assumptions of stimulus legislation occurring, and it  s really the market  s hope that those actions occur and that there isn  t a heated battle and a water down of some of these indicated proposals by the soon-to-be new administration,\" Ghriskey said. Apple shares fell 0.8 percent after a report that the company will trim iPhone production. Shares of Apple suppliers such as Cirrus Logic and Qualcomm also declined. Tech was the worst-performing major S&amp;P sector, falling 1 percent. Big tech names such as Microsoft and Alphabet slumped more than 1 percent. Investors are wary that the market could be primed for a spill to start 2017, after the S&amp;P 500 posted a surprisingly strong gain in 2016. In other corporate news, OPKO Health shares fell 18.8 percent after the company said its experimental drug for growth hormone deficiency in adults failed to provide a statistically significant benefit in a late-stage study. About 5.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, below the 6.8 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.23-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.49-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&amp;P 500 posted 1 new 52-week high and 1 new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 58 new highs and 48 new lows.

The executives have until 5:30 p.m. ET to do so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Nasdaq composite index gained 65.02, or 5.1 percent, to reach 1,334.30. The Dow Jones industrial average added 260.92, or 3.1 percent, to close at 8,743.31; it had been down more than 120 points earlier in the day.</p><p>The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index added 35.41, or 4 percent, to end the day at 919.62.</p><p>Treasury prices gave back much of their early gains, although the 10-year note yield still was at multi-decade lows of 4.10 percent. The yield fell below 4 percent earlier before bouncing up. The rotation out of Treasurys boosted equities.</p><p>\"I didn't see anything fundamental to turn us around. I think it's a combination of program buying and asset reallocation,\" said Tim Heekin, head of stock trading at Thomas Weisel Partners.</p><p>\"Bonds finally showed a little reversal. We put in a high on the long-terms and then dipped off of that. I think the big bond funds came in and started taking profits after the recent run. The real test will be if we can hold these levels.\"</p><p>Traders said the stock turnaround was also partly due to short-covering, the process in which investors who have sold shares short to take advantage of a falling market buy them back.</p><p>Big tech companies, such as Sun Microsystems (SUNW: up $0.51 to $4.44) and Oracle (ORCL: up $0.96 to $10.05), boosted the Nasdaq on no discernable news, while gains in tech names such as Microsoft (MSFT: up $2.66 to $49.71) and IBM (IBM: up $3.02 to $74.92) helped push the Dow higher.</p><p>Retailers also experienced a recovery after Dow component Wal-Mart Stores (WMT: up $3.91 to $52.62) made a late-day announcement that it will buy back up to $5 billion of outstanding shares, a move often seen as a vote of corporate confidence. The No. 1 retailer also said it will expense stock options.</p><p>According to a regulatory filing made public Tuesday, computer hardware maker and Dow component IBM (IBM: up $3.02 to $74.92) said it is cutting more than 15,600 jobs, beyond what had been expected, in its computer-services and microelectronics businesses.</p><p>Shares of Network Appliance (NTAP: up $1.95 to $9.00) rallied after the data storage computer maker posted a quarterly profit Tuesday and forecast a modest rise in revenue in the current quarter.</p><p>Chip equipment maker Applied Materials (AMAT: up $0.96 to $14.42) said it earned 7 cents a share in its third quarter, 2 cents better than estimates and in line with results a year earlier. The company also warned that orders in the current quarter could drop as much as 15 percent. The news had knocked the stock lower earlier in the day, but it recovered in the broader tech surge.<br/>\u00a0<br/>UAL may file for bankruptcy</p><p>Stocks in the aviation sector continued to suffer Wednesday in the fallout from US Airways bankruptcy filing earlier this week. The New York Stock Exchange has suspended trading of the stock.</p><p>After the close of trade, United Airlines parent UAL (UAL: down $0.29 to $2.45) said that it may be forced to file for bankruptcy court protection in the fourth quarter, barring any last-minute cash infusion that could help it deal with its mounting debt.</p><p>Fellow airlines, as well as companies that deal in aerospace and defense such as Dow components Boeing (BA: down $0.71 to $36.35) and United Technologies (UTX: down $1.12 to $61.35), traded lower.</p><p>Late in the session, United Technologies reaffirmed 2002 earnings per share of $4.40, a penny better than estimates. But the stock remained a notable Dow laggard.</p><p>\"Conventional wisdom was that this down cycle with commercial airlines was going to bottom this year. But with US Air declaring bankruptcy, UAL in danger and American scaling back, it's become pretty clear that bottoming is going to be delayed,\" said Robert Norfleet, an aerospace and defense analyst with Davenport &amp; Co.</p><p>\"The fear is that orders from these companies will be deferred, delayed or cancelled and that this will negatively impact future profits at the companies that deal in production and parts, which is why these stocks have been down all week,\" he added.<br/>\u00a0<br/>CEO certification deadline</p><p>Wednesday is the final day by which 697 CEOs must certify the results of their most recent quarter, a new policy set up to reassure investors after the spate of accounting and corporate governance concerns that have plagued markets for months.</p><p>Officially, 316 CEO certifications are outstanding, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission Web site.</p><p>However, the SEC is not able to update its Web site immediately after the filings; the unofficial number of outstanding companies that are both listed and not bankrupt is approximately 71, a far smaller number. In addition, it may not be known immediately how many companies failed to certify on time, as they can get a five-day extension with a request made Thursday.</p><p>One of the concerns about the CEO certifications has been the potential for companies to restate results. A number of companies fulfilled that fear Wednesday morning.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Federal Reserve released its latest interest rate decision and economic commentary. The central bank acknowledged the economic slowdown by changing its bias to one of weakness from neutral, but also left interest rates unchanged at 1.75 percent, a move seen by some market participants as disappointing.</p><p>\"The Fed's choice to hold rates steady was no big surprise. People may have been using that as an excuse to sell at the top of a trading range,\" said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Global Partners Securities. \"And we're probably going to be in a bit of a trading range until we get some new economic data that makes people want to move one way or the other.\"</p><p>In the day's economic news, June business inventories rose 0.2 percent, more than the 0.1 percent increase forecast of economists surveyed by Briefing.com. While the news was seen as positive, it appeared to have little impact on trade.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNCOM-20020814wallstthurs</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNCOM2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49R6-5F90-01VR-906J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">266325</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1035\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CNN.com</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"15303\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><copyright>Copyright 2002 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>August 14, 2002 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Rules &amp;

Amazon and Alibaba have already loaned billions of dollars. And Facebook wants you to use Messenger to pay your friends back for dinner. Make no mistake, Silicon Valley tech giants are climbing into the financial services playground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the decade following the recession we've seen fintech startups precipitate incremental change in the financial services space. Disruptors have reimagined components of the financial services puzzle and nudged Wall Street into the digital age, creating the competition necessary to force traditional financial companies to compete on multiple fronts: product innovation, user experience, transparency and value.</p><p>But ultimately, fintech startups and Wall Street giants played nice. Many financial services companies saw the writing on the wall and decided that if they couldn't move quickly enough to incubate those innovations in-house, they could join forces with newcomers through strategic partnerships. It turned out this was the beginning of a mutually beneficial friendship, resulting in a huge win for consumers.</p><p>In 2015, Jamie Dimon gave his ominous warning that \"Silicon Valley is coming.\" Wall Street was able to weather the storm in subsequent years, but they're not out of the woods.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">With a deep user base, tech looms large</emphasis></h><p>For Wall Street, Big Tech poses a threat to financial services that is, well, bigger. Amazon, Apple and Alphabet-currently the second, third and fourth largest companies in the United States-have something that the small fintech start-ups lack: Scale. A lot of it.</p><p>If Fintech 1.0 was all about plucky startups working to elevate the standards that consumers expected from financial services companies, Fintech 2.0 is about Silicon Valley behemoths turbocharging that mindset with the backing of billions of dollars of capital.</p><p>These companies bring to the table the best cloud, data and AI resources on the planet. No one knows better than these giants how to surround a customer with an experience so seamlessly connected that the ease of use is worth the sacrifice of privacy (something traditional financial firms have struggled to deliver).</p><p>This is, in part, because most tech players have kept reputations as friendly giants. Their Net Promoter Scores soar high above big banks. People are willing to give a company like Google all their information if it makes it easy to toggle between their laptop, their phone and an IoT device. What if Google's deep data troves could give you a holistic view of your financial picture too?</p><p>What does this mean for Wall Street? The bar for best-in-class UX is about to be raised again.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020 could impact competition</emphasis></h><p>Regulatory headwinds could slow Big Tech's penetration into finance. Just last month, Congress made moves to stymie Facebook and friends from launching their take on a cryptocurrency, Libra, with the aptly named \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act.\" And, in the first Democratic debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the breakup of America's largest tech players. With an election coming, it remains to be seen whether the House and Senate will turn red, purple or blue. But the parties in power will influence the future role that Big Tech can play in the financial services ecosystem.</p><p>Regardless of how things evolve, in the early innings of Fintech 2.0, Big Tech has changed the game.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The future of financial marketing comms</emphasis></h><p>Let's face it: Wall Street and Silicon Valley come from very different marketing communications schools of thought. As they square off to fight for share of wallet, there are marketing and communications lessons that Wall Street and Silicon Valley can learn from one another.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dear Big Tech, don't forget thought leadership:</emphasis> In the years following the Financial Crisis, finance became commoditized-in product and cost-and the best way to win customer trust was in a race to capture share-of-voice through thought leadership.</p><p>Big firms launched thought leadership programs-often composed of a combination of proprietary research, earned media, content, and social/digital activations-that dug into consumers' emotional relationships with money, explored the role gender dynamics plays in investing and provided the tips to help people navigate financial decisions. Part group therapy, part actionable financial insights, consumer finance marketing communications became more human. This financial expertise and thought leadership is what sets traditional financial players apart from tech giants.</p><p>As Big Tech matures in the financial services realm, it could stand to take a leaf out of Wall Street's book, by going to market above product, addressing consumers' real desire for financial tips, education and empathy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wall Street, it's time to evolve your value prop:</emphasis> Wall Street also has a lesson to learn from Silicon Valley.</p><p>If Big Tech knows how to do one thing, it's to cultivate a user experience that is simple, well-designed and engaging. As these tech players dive fully into the financial services competitor set, customer expectations for user interface, PFM, smart analytics and AI are about to climb yet again.</p><p>In order to continue to thrive, traditional financial players will need to prove that they can match their counterparts in cultivating a compelling user experience that centers around an excellent product. As tech players challenge traditional financial models, Wall Street will need to make sure they're focusing on price, product and innovation as much as their competition is.</p><p>Wall Street has shown itself to be resilient and-by and large-willing to evolve to keep up with their customers' expectations. If they can continue to lead the way in financial thought leadership while delivering on UX, they stand in good stead for the future.</p><p>The financial services marketplace is entering a second wave of rapid evolution. But if Wall Street and Silicon Valley can learn a little from each other, then, ultimately, the end user will come out on top.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Julia Bloch Mellon is Senior Vice President of Financial Services at Bliss Integrated Communication</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Julia Bloch Mellon</emphasis></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ODWYER-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ODWYER2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WTD-XKC1-JC8V-42VP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8201</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 J.R.

Amazon and Alibaba have already loaned billions of dollars. And Facebook wants you to use Messenger to pay your friends back for dinner. Make no mistake, Silicon Valley tech giants are climbing into the financial services playground.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the decade following the recession we've seen fintech startups precipitate incremental change in the financial services space. Disruptors have reimagined components of the financial services puzzle and nudged Wall Street into the digital age, creating the competition necessary to force traditional financial companies to compete on multiple fronts: product innovation, user experience, transparency and value.</p><p>But ultimately, fintech startups and Wall Street giants played nice. Many financial services companies saw the writing on the wall and decided that if they couldn't move quickly enough to incubate those innovations in-house, they could join forces with newcomers through strategic partnerships. It turned out this was the beginning of a mutually beneficial friendship, resulting in a huge win for consumers.</p><p>In 2015, Jamie Dimon gave his ominous warning that \"Silicon Valley is coming.\" Wall Street was able to weather the storm in subsequent years, but they're not out of the woods.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">With a deep user base, tech looms large</emphasis></h><p>For Wall Street, Big Tech poses a threat to financial services that is, well, bigger. Amazon, Apple and Alphabet-currently the second, third and fourth largest companies in the United States-have something that the small fintech start-ups lack: Scale. A lot of it.</p><p>If Fintech 1.0 was all about plucky startups working to elevate the standards that consumers expected from financial services companies, Fintech 2.0 is about Silicon Valley behemoths turbocharging that mindset with the backing of billions of dollars of capital.</p><p>These companies bring to the table the best cloud, data and AI resources on the planet. No one knows better than these giants how to surround a customer with an experience so seamlessly connected that the ease of use is worth the sacrifice of privacy (something traditional financial firms have struggled to deliver).</p><p>This is, in part, because most tech players have kept reputations as friendly giants. Their Net Promoter Scores soar high above big banks. People are willing to give a company like Google all their information if it makes it easy to toggle between their laptop, their phone and an IoT device. What if Google's deep data troves could give you a holistic view of your financial picture too?</p><p>What does this mean for Wall Street? The bar for best-in-class UX is about to be raised again.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2020 could impact competition</emphasis></h><p>Regulatory headwinds could slow Big Tech's penetration into finance. Just last month, Congress made moves to stymie Facebook and friends from launching their take on a cryptocurrency, Libra, with the aptly named \"Keep Big Tech Out of Finance Act.\" And, in the first Democratic debate, Senator Elizabeth Warren called for the breakup of America's largest tech players. With an election coming, it remains to be seen whether the House and Senate will turn red, purple or blue. But the parties in power will influence the future role that Big Tech can play in the financial services ecosystem.</p><p>Regardless of how things evolve, in the early innings of Fintech 2.0, Big Tech has changed the game.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The future of financial marketing comms</emphasis></h><p>Let's face it: Wall Street and Silicon Valley come from very different marketing communications schools of thought. As they square off to fight for share of wallet, there are marketing and communications lessons that Wall Street and Silicon Valley can learn from one another.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dear Big Tech, don't forget thought leadership:</emphasis> In the years following the Financial Crisis, finance became commoditized-in product and cost-and the best way to win customer trust was in a race to capture share-of-voice through thought leadership.</p><p>Big firms launched thought leadership programs-often composed of a combination of proprietary research, earned media, content, and social/digital activations-that dug into consumers' emotional relationships with money, explored the role gender dynamics plays in investing and provided the tips to help people navigate financial decisions. Part group therapy, part actionable financial insights, consumer finance marketing communications became more human. This financial expertise and thought leadership is what sets traditional financial players apart from tech giants.</p><p>As Big Tech matures in the financial services realm, it could stand to take a leaf out of Wall Street's book, by going to market above product, addressing consumers' real desire for financial tips, education and empathy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wall Street, it's time to evolve your value prop:</emphasis> Wall Street also has a lesson to learn from Silicon Valley.</p><p>If Big Tech knows how to do one thing, it's to cultivate a user experience that is simple, well-designed and engaging. As these tech players dive fully into the financial services competitor set, customer expectations for user interface, PFM, smart analytics and AI are about to climb yet again.</p><p>In order to continue to thrive, traditional financial players will need to prove that they can match their counterparts in cultivating a compelling user experience that centers around an excellent product. As tech players challenge traditional financial models, Wall Street will need to make sure they're focusing on price, product and innovation as much as their competition is.</p><p>Wall Street has shown itself to be resilient and-by and large-willing to evolve to keep up with their customers' expectations. If they can continue to lead the way in financial thought leadership while delivering on UX, they stand in good stead for the future.</p><p>The financial services marketplace is entering a second wave of rapid evolution. But if Wall Street and Silicon Valley can learn a little from each other, then, ultimately, the end user will come out on top.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Julia Bloch Mellon is Senior Vice President of Financial Services at Bliss Integrated Communication</emphasis>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Julia Bloch Mellon</emphasis></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ODWYER-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ODWYER2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBM-8T61-DYRW-V49V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8201</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1011\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 J.R.

POLITICO also reported that more than 90 percent of staff donations from major tech firms like Alphabet, Apple, eBay, Facebook, Netflix and Twitter went to Democratic candidates.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And it's not just Big Tech: despite Democrats' tendency to distrust Wall Street and call for more financial regulation, big Wall Street donors are giving more to Democrats than Republicans this year, according to a New York Times report.</p><p>If Democrats take the House, Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) will likely become chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee. As a consistently outspoken critic of Wall Street and a proponent of stricter Wall Street regulations, some industry players fear she will crack down on them if they don't get on her good side now.</p><p>While Democrats are more prone than ever to heavily regulate Silicon Valley and Wall Street given the recent string of scandals at Facebook and Google over privacy concerns and Democrats' persistent distrust of the finance industry, backing Democrats now could be a way to mitigate some of the regulatory damage.</p><p>Tech and telecom firms have acknowledged in recent hearings that the U.S. needs some form of federal privacy standard, and various companies like AT&amp;T and Alphabet have told Congress they are willing to work with them on legislation that works for everyone.</p><p>Silicon Valley is especially wary of consumer advocates swaying Congress -- consumer-focused legislation in the European Union (EU), for example, like the GDPR and updated Copyright Directive, are extremely unpopular among U.S. tech companies.</p><p>That said, donating to candidates most likely to win could help tech companies -- and finance companies -- maintain some influence over the next round of tech regulations.</p><p>\"Money gets you access,\" said Lawrence White, professor of economics at New York University's Leonard N. Stern School of Business. \"Even if it comes a Democratic Congress, and there's financial reform regulation on the table, the Wall Street guys want to be able to talk to the staff of the Senate Banking Committee and the House Financial Services Committee,and just point out, here are the implications [from our end].\"</p><p>The number of donations going to Democrats has less to do with who Wall Street and Silicon want in office and more to do with how they think midterms will go, he said.</p><p>In other words, they're betting on a \"Blue Wave.\"</p><p>\"My guess is that's what they're predicting,\" he told InsideSources. \"The question of whether Maxine Waters becomes chair of the committee is an interesting one, that would be less than ideal from the Wall Street perspective. But Waters has to carry her committee with her. The chair has a lot of power, no question about that, but she has to carry her committee with her. Having the ability to talk to people at the end of the day is really what it's all about.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2018 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

We will tell you which stocks viewers voted out of the IN THE MONEY portfolio and where that leaves our collection of stocks.</p><p>TUCKER: The popularity of on-line trading is exploding in Asia. It could mean big investment opportunities for U.S. investors.  We'll tell you why.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: From CNN and CNNfn, this is IN THE MONEY with Terry Keenan, Bill Tucker, and Daryn Kagan.</p><p>TUCKER: Good morning, everyone, and welcome to IN THE MONEY.</p><p>KEENAN: And it is back to work Monday.  We are all hoping, though, that we won't see an instant replay of last week's wild market ride.  We have tips from lots of pros, and where you might want to put your money to work this week.</p><p>TUCKER: Today, so far, so good, Wall Street is rather calm this morning, as we head into the first busy week of the earnings season.</p><p>KEENAN: That's right.  We have a whole slew of companies that are getting ready to release their numbers this week.  We have GE, we have Time Warner, the parent of this networks, lots of tech stocks as well.</p><p>TUCKER: And then after the bell, we get Motorola, first big tech company to release its quarterly numbers today.  Lots of stuff going on in market.  We talk about, there is no volatility, there apparently is no volatility right now, but we did start out higher, and we have had both of these markets turn around, the Dow up, forging ahead though at the start of this week.</p><p>Well, for more on what's moving on Wall Street let's head down to the New York Stock Exchange and to Rhonda Schaffler.</p><p>Rhonda, what's driving the Dow?</p><p>RHONDA SCHAFFLER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hey, there, Bill, Terry.</p><p>Well, you know, there is a lot of components within the Dow, racing higher here.  There has been a move today, at least, back into some of those old-economy stocks, as the techs sell-off.  And in fact, one Merrill Lynch strategist talked up that fact in a research note out today that perhaps investors should cut their exposure to techs and move into some of these old-economy stocks.  And within the Dow, the best performing group are financial stocks, and it is the same for here on the Big Board, huge gains in some of the financial stocks, including the financial components within the Dow, American Express and J.P. Morgan.  We are seeing gains in brokerage firms, too, such as Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Charles Schwab.</p><p>One reason for this is, there is a merger within that sector, and that is Wells Fargo, that stock is little changed at the moment.  It is merging with First Security in a deal valued at just over $3 billion.  Wells Fargo based in San Francisco, and the bank that it is acquiring is based in Utah.</p><p>The fact that there is a merger is being talked up here, and it is cited as one reason why there is a lot of buying in the financial stocks today.</p><p>TUCKER: Motorola also catching a lot of people's attentions, Rhonda.</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Motorola was a big gainer on Friday.  In fact, some of the strength we saw in chip stocks last week not continuing to the extent we are seeing today, but that company is due to report earnings.  Motorola's stock has had an incredible run.  It is not trading near its highs right now.  It is about $30 away from its 52- week high.  That stock was trading at about 70 a share, when it hit its 52-week low, due out with earnings today.  It is considered a bellwether to report, and the stock was up $9 Friday, earnings looking to be about 58 cents a share, that is what Wall Street is expecting.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, great, expectations are high for Motorola. Let's hope they don't disappoint for tech investors' sake.  Thank you, Rhonda,</p><p>Let's take a quick look and see how the bond market is faring today.  We got a little bit of buying in the bond market.  So, as prices rise, the yield falls.  That is the nature of the bond market. With the 30-year bond yielding 5.69, the 10-year note showing a yield 5.81.  So we do have some interest rate stability, in fact a little bit of a downward trend, in terms of interest rates at least in the market.</p><p>KEENAN: And a downward trend, as well, on the Nasdaq.  When all was said and done last week, we were off three percent for that index, and a bit of selling pressure this morning, though we are well off our worst levels of the session. Let's go over to Charles Molineaux at the Nasdaq marketsite in Times Square.</p><p>And Charles, let's start with a look at some of those big-cap names because we are seeing a bit of selling in Microsoft and a few others; right?</p><p>CHARLES MOLINEAUX, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yes, we are, actually most of them are down, today, Terry.  Take a look, for example, Cisco Systems the biggest of bunch is actually up by 11/16 or 8/10, but Microsoft, yes, it is down by $2, 2 1/2 percent.  Cisco, first part, is cashing in on the acquisition of Altega Networks (ph) and using Altega resources to rollout a portfolio of broadband solutions for remote access and BPN's Virtual Private Networks.  Microsoft, meanwhile, over the weekend it made the D.J.  List of hot stocks to watch in \"Barron's.\" Microsoft has a definitive agreement for a three- year strategic alliance with VerticalNet.  The idea is to deliver business-to-business e-commerce services and content to small and medium-sized businesses.  That is not helping.</p><p>Intel is up though.  It's gained a dollar, or one percent, on the day today.  It's reportedly going to be giving away an open-source version of its advanced security software, offering it for free over the Internet.  And its planning to invest $6 billion a year to increase chip production.  Oracle is down by about a buck.  Its secure technology is going to integrate its product with Oracle's Internet directory.  Sun Microsystems is also up by almost 2 percent, or $1.75. Sun and the Molderog Group (ph) are expanding their content Bost Solution (ph), which enables broadcast companies to take advantage of the integration between traditional programming and the Internet.  So the big caps generally down.</p><p>KEENAN: And, Charles, another big cap, Biogen, a bellwether biotech company, also out with results later today.  How does that stock make out of that?</p><p>MOLINEAUX: Biotech, big cap and a bellwether, absolutely.  It's expected to report quarterly profits of 4 to 3 cents a year from 29 a year ago.  And it is up on the day $1 11/16 or 2 1/2 percent.  So a good story there.</p><p>KEENAN: And another story, of course, we're following: Adtran. What's going on there?</p><p>MOLINEAUX: Adtran, actually, already reported its earnings. They made 42 cents a share and that beat the estimates of 35 cents, also up from 24 cents for the same period a year ago.  This is its best first quarter performance ever.  The company says its shipments went up quarter, although the quarter -- the expenses stayed on plan, so its profit margins got better.  It, however, is down on the day. Look at this: It was off by 2 13/16, 4.1 percent.  Actually, Adtran was looking very positive and strong earlier in the day, and it's just fallen off the cliff, now down by 2 -- down 265 1/16.  Positive report but maybe a little profit-taking.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks, Charles. Charles Molineaux.</p><p>TUCKER: Yes, and I was looking at Adtran, but we got to set a little context here: 52 weeks ago, that was a $16 stock.  So 65 may be a little weak today, but over the past year it's been a very strong performer.</p><p>Well, our next guest says investors should accept the volatility we're seeing in the market because it's here to stay.  Instead, he advises us to track down the sectors with long-term growth and then stick with them.</p><p>KEENAN: For some advice on which sectors he thinks are safe, we're joined now by Bob Walberg.  He's the chief equity strategist with Briefing.com, and he joins us from Chicago.</p><p>And welcome back, Bob.  And good morning.  Good to have you with us.</p><p>BOB WALBERG, BRIEFING.COM: Good to be here, Terry, Bill.</p><p>KEENAN: Crazy week last week.  The dust appears to have settled a bit.  What do you advise investors to do from here?</p><p>WALBERG: Well, I think if you're involved -- if you're looking in the technology sector in particular and you're looking longer term, you want to be basically saying, I want to be involved in those sectors of the economy which are likely to experience much-better- than-market growth for the next several years and I'm willing to ride out, you know, the waves, the volatile waves that we've seen like last week and last October and so on.</p><p>So you're going to focus on, I think, areas like the wireless industry, the chip equipment industry.  You want to be looking at the Net backbone stocks and you want to be focussing on those companies which are providing leadership within those sectors, and you want to buy those stocks.  And when you get dips like we had last week, you want to go back in and buy again.  And when you have long-term rides up to the upside, you simply wait it out, possibly reduce a little bit of exposure at that time.  But, overall, I still think technology is going to be the place to be over the next several years.</p><p>TUCKER: Very calm and self-assured viewpoint Bob, but there's a lot of nervous about technology stocks in particular.  And in this morning's commentary on Briefing.com, you note that there's a little bit of a war setup this week between rising interest rates in earnings which are due out this week.  You ultimately think earnings will be the winner and that investors are right getting in this market now?</p><p>WALBERG: Well, I think, from a very short-term perspective, Bill, yes, I think earnings are going to be, you know, the winner here.  That'll be the catalyst that keeps technology stocks moving higher over the short term.  However, if, you know, we look later on this week, we have both the PPI and the CPI numbers coming out, if they remain very strong and it indicates -- and it looks like the Fed may raise rates instead of by 25 basis points in May, by 50 basis points, that then becomes a bigger concern for the, you know, the market as a whole as real rates are now at their highest rate since 1989.  And we're also seeing an inversion of the funds rate 10-year curve.  Both of those things suggest that we're going to see a slowing in economic growth by year's end of anywhere from 2 to 3 percent.</p><p>KEENAN: Bob, what about the Internet stocks? because a lot of the well-known names that went public with a lot of fanfare last year have just been decimated, down 60, 70 percent.  Are there any of those that look attractive to you?</p><p>WALBERG: Well, not necessarily.  I mean, if you look at like the e-tailing and the content stocks, I think most of those stocks that are down now are going to stay down.  I think you really want to be avoiding most of the plays there.  Don't look for bargains in that group.  I think if you move up forward to like a lot of the business- to-business stocks that really got hit here in recent weeks, I think you can do some selective buying there in the quality names, such as Ariba and Oracle and Commerce One.  However, I think even there you're going to see a shakeout, names like PurchasePro.  Some of the secondary names, we think, SyQuest, aren't going to be coming back and they're going to suffer a similar fate that we've seen to the second- and third-tier content e-tailing sites.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, Bob, you gave us the sectors you like.  Give us the name of at least a couple of stocks we should be taking a look at here.</p><p>WALBERG: Well, sure.  In the wireless area, you know, obviously you want to be looking at -- the big names are Qualcomm and Nokia. And taking it down a peg, I think you can look at a stock like Puma Technology which has had a sizable pullback here recently.  I think that's a stock you want to be buying aggressively for the long term. If you move toward the chip equipment industry, really I think it's one of those throw a dart at the board.  The whole sector looks tremendous right now.  But in some of the names we really like are obviously Applied Materials, which is the leader there.  I also think you can be buying Novellus and KLA-Tencor.  Coliceton (ph) Cellphone looks good as well.</p><p>Again, if we move into the net backbone stocks, really like Redback Networks, Cisco Systems, obviously, and Juniper Networks.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, Bob, thanks a lot.  Bob Walberg of Briefing.com.</p><p>WALBERG: Thank you</p><p>TUCKER: Coming up on IN THE MONEY: fatal flaw, or human error? The Marine Corps begins the painstaking search for answers to Saturday's deadly Osprey crash.</p><p>KEENAN: And we will also find out what one of the nation's top tech portfolio managers is doing to protect his investments in these tumultuous markets.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK) TUCKER: And good morning, our \"Wake-Up Call\" this morning going out to someone with a lot of green, a new green jacket and a lot of money.  Vijay Singh, of Fiji, is the winner of the 64th Masters tournament.  It is his second time as champion.  That 18-foot birdie you saw on the final hole was the icing on the cake.  For his efforts, he takes home $838,000, that is for 72 holes of golf.  It works out to a little bit better than $11,000 a hole.  Not bad.</p><p>KEENAN: Not bad, no, not bad at all.</p><p>Well, surprising diplomatic overtures between two mortal enemies, Bill Hemmer joins us with that and more from CNN Center in Atlanta.</p><p>Hello, again, Bill.</p><p>BILL HEMMER, CNN ANCHOR: Terry and Bill, hello, again, to you as well.</p><p>From overseas, we begin with North and South Korea, they announced today that their leaders will hold a historic summit meeting.  That meeting scheduled now for June 12 to run in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang.  One South Korean official says the talks will focus on economic cooperation.</p><p>The White House welcomed news of the summit.  It will be the first direct talks between two presidents since the Korean peninsula was partitioned back in 1945.</p><p>Back in this country, attorneys for Elian Gonzalez's Miami relatives indicate today their clients plan to fight for custody every step of the way.  A team of mental health professionals supposed to meet with family members in Miami this afternoon.  The boy's great uncle asked that the meeting be considered tentative because his daughter has been hospitalized for exhaustion.</p><p>Marisleysis Gonzalez has acted as Elian's surrogate mother. Still, the Justice Department is moving forward with plans to bring Elian and his father back together by the end of the week.  Juan Miguel Gonzalez traveled to the U.S. from Cuba last Thursday, hoping to reclaim his son.</p><p>Military investigators are scouring the scorched Arizona site, where a Marine aircraft crashed Saturday night.  All 19 people on board were killed when the MV-22 Osprey went down during a training mission.  The new mission now is to finding out why.</p><p>CNN's Don Knapp now live from Southern Arizona with more from there.</p><p>Don, Hello.</p><p>DON KNAPP, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Hello, Bill.  As you know, that is a hybrid aircraft that attempts to be a helicopter, and an airplane. When it is flying with its engines forward in horizontal flight, it depends on its wings for lift.  When it is trying to land, as it was last night, the rotors tilt straight up, and it tries to land like a helicopter, that is when something went wrong, the aircraft pitched over and nose-dived in.</p><p>You are probably looking right now at the burned remains on the ground, in those -- in the remains of aircraft are the remains of the 19 Marines.  We have now confirmed from the Pentagon, the remains are still there, and will not be removed until initial phases of the investigation get underway.</p><p>Sitting not far from the burned Osprey is the other Osprey that was also used in the civilian evacuation exercise.  It is an MV-22 turboprop aircraft the Marines have been evaluating to replace their older Seaknight CH-46 (ph) helicopters.</p><p>Of the 19 Marines that were killed, 14 were from the Marine base at Camp Pendleton, there was one from Miramar Naval Air Station near San Diego, and four from the Presidential Helicopter Squadron in QuanticoVirginia, that is the same squadron that provides pilots for the president's Marine One -- Bill.</p><p>HEMMER: Don, let's talk about the pending investigation, the cockpit voice recorder not contained on this aircraft, but there is a flight data recorder, how will investigators use that?</p><p>KNAPP: Well, if they get it, you have to understand that those remains are burned very badly.  If it comes out and if it is OK, obviously they will get a lot of data, and this is very complex aircraft aerodynamically, with its rotors going from straight vertical to straightforward.  So I'm sure there is a lot of instrumentation that is involved.</p><p>If that information comes out well, it can either make a case for or against the ability of this aircraft to work as promised.</p><p>HEMMER: All right, Don Knapp, live in Southern Arizona, this morning.</p><p>Now back to New York, with Bill and Terry.  More news now.  We will have another update in 30 minutes' time.  We will see you then.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, terrific, Bill, we will look for you.</p><p>HEMMER: OK.</p><p>KEENAN: And coming up next on IN THE MONEY: If you're invested in a mutual fund, you may want to stick around to find out if your fund is one of this year's top performers.</p><p>TUCKER: Plus, the hot topic today is technology stocks.  We will speak to a fund hot-hand about where you might want to be putting your money now.  Stay with us.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: Here we are getting a live picture of the board at the New York Stock Exchange, a triple-digit gain for the Dow industrials right now, despite a sell-off in shares of Hewlett-Packard, that stock is down 3 3/8, but we're seeing some strength in the financials. TUCKER: Well, Janus Capital, the blue chip of the mutual fund industry, isn't getting the proper prescription from Healtheon/WebMD. Despite the on-line medical information company's 35 percent surge on Friday, the stock is down about $34 since Janus bought 15 million shares of it at $62 a share in January.  That means Janus has lost close to half a billion dollars on paper.  But a company spokesman says the firm sold some of its stock for profit, wouldn't say how much, or when those sales were made, and the three Janus funds invested in Healtheon have performed pretty well this year so far, with Global Sciences already up 20 percent.</p><p>KEENAN: Well, mutual funds were a good place to be last quarter. Most U.S. diversified stock funds enjoyed a pretty strong performance in the first three months of the year.  Leading the pack, those technology funds, although some of their gains were offset last week with the big sell-off in the tech sector on the first week of the new quarter.</p><p>Let's take a look at the top five leaders and losers.  The best- performing fund for the first quarter was Pin Oak Aggressive stock fund, followed by Quint Slattery's (ph) PBHG New Opportunities fund, we talked about that a bit on Friday, and Kopp Emerging Growth, Berkshire Focus and Green Century Balanced, round out the list there.</p><p>The biggest losers was ProFunds UltraShort OTC fund, which is down almost 40 percent for the quarter, that was followed by the Rydex Arktos and Weitz Hickory funds.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, we now take a look at Northern Technology Fund, which has reaped the benefits of some of the money in-flows that Terry just mentioned.  Run by a three-person team, the fund has scaled back on its exposure to the likes of Microsoft and Dell, which has been proven to be a wise move, since both stocks have trailed rest of the tech market.  That helped the fund gain 135 percent last year, and so far this year, it's up about 13 percent, which compares to the Nasdaq, which is up not quite that.</p><p>Joining us now from Chicago is John Leo, one of the triumvirates who runs the Northern Technology Fund.</p><p>And welcome John, welcome to IN THE MONEY.</p><p>JOHN LEO, NORTHERN TECHNOLOGY FUND: Thank you very much.</p><p>TUCKER: You know, we were talking with Bob Walberg of Briefing.com a little earlier and he said that volatility in the technology sector is here to stay, get used to it.  Would that be your counsel as well?</p><p>LEO: I think we are, or we ought to expect volatility to be with us for at least a quarter or two, after the big gains that we have seen in this sector the last six or nine months.  We are entering a period of time where there are sometimes some seasonal challenges for technology companies.  So, expect the volatility.</p><p>KEENAN: I noticed some of your top holdings are among the most volatile stocks, the so-called momentum stocks, that people have been piling into, in the last six months or so, JDS Uniphase and Broadcom among them.  Are you starting to -- starting to lighten up on some of those names given what we saw last week?</p><p>LEO: We are not lightening up on the names that you mentioned, those and several others are companies where we see the absolute strongest fundamental stories developing.  What we are doing, and we do expect some selectivity in terms of the behavior that investors use over the course of the next couple of quarters, so we are being more selective ourselves, in terms of where we are putting money, and pulling back in some of the places where we our conviction is a little less robust.</p><p>TUCKER: John, we have grown used to in the past month, of using the phrase \"old economy,\" \"new-economy\" stocks.  You are suggesting, however, there is \"new technology\" and \"old technology\" stocks.  What do you mean by that?</p><p>LEO: Well, I think what I mean there, is that some of these companies that are developing new aspects of communications or driving new developments in the communications field, are places that investors ought to spend some time digging in and looking.  For instance, telephone companies are having to reinvest and rebuild their entire telecom infrastructure.  And that is where you get some good play for companies like JDS Uniphase, companies that are building out these optical networks.</p><p>KEENAN: You've been scaling back on Microsoft, why?</p><p>LEO: Well, Microsoft is a company that is under the gun from a couple of perspectives, and not just the legal issues that they are facing, but also the fact that the market and technology is moving from a PC-centric type of architecture to an Internet-centric architecture, and it is hard for a big company like Microsoft, or Intel for that matter, to change its stripes as quickly as it would like.  This move to the Internet-centric architecture is what causes us to take a step back with Microsoft.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks John, we appreciate your ideas.</p><p>LEO: You are welcome.</p><p>KEENAN: John Leo of the Northern Technology Fund.</p><p>KEENAN: And coming up next on IN THE MONEY: From the assembly line to the picket line, Lockheed's machinists have walked off the job.</p><p>TUCKER: Also, is it really buy-to-buy for B2B?  Why one technology incubator is switching its focus away from one of this year's hottest sectors.  Should you maybe do the same?</p><p>KEENAN: And we are in selling mode.  You decided what stocks we should toss out of our portfolio, we've compiled the list.  Which IN THE MONEY stocks do viewers think are out of the running?  We'll tell you, coming up next. (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TUCKER: There you have it, ladies and gentlemen, geography quiz, you've seen it before, but do you remember it?  I hope so, you're looking down south at Lower Manhattan.  Those are the world financial centers over to the right, big tall buildings in the middle, World Trade Center.</p><p>KEENAN: A lovely day after a crazy weekend, the weekend's weather was kind of like the markets last week, when we had\u2026</p><p>TUCKER: You know, it was actually, it was a really perfect ending to the week, such a nutty week.  I wake up at 5:30 in the morning on Sunday and I've got two inches of snow in my yard.  How do you figure that?</p><p>KEENAN: Yes, incredible, and on Saturday you needed sun screen in Manhattan.</p><p>TUCKER: Exactly.</p><p>KEENAN: Such a beautiful day.</p><p>Well, hello everyone, and welcome back to IN THE MONEY.  I'm Terry Keenan.</p><p>TUCKER: And hello from Bill Hemmer, Daryn Kagan and me as well. In just a moment, you helped us with some spring cleaning in the IN THE MONEY portfolio.  We'll tell you which of the stocks that you want us to sell.</p><p>KEENAN: But time now to check some stories making the business headlines this morning.  The Dow is looking strong as investors move into the airline, the banking, brokerage, and drug stocks.  In fact, J.P.  Morgan is overweighting its drug holdings this morning.  That is helping out some of the stocks in the sector.  Among the ones J.P. Morgan likes: Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn and Bristol-Myers.</p><p>Technology stocks on the Nasdaq, though, not faring as well. Merrill Lynch's Richard McCabe (ph) warns that it's the beginning of, quote, \"an important corrective trend,\" and he is moving out of those tech names.</p><p>Earning seasons is getting into full swing this week, two companies in the IN THE MONEY portfolio will release their numbers today, Motorola and Biogen are expected to report earnings significantly higher than a year ago.</p><p>And Motorola is joining together with 12 other companies in a major home networking alliance today.  The non-profit will create a standard for and promote just plugging into electrical outlets at home to connect computers and other devices to the Internet.  The companies involved include Motorola, but also Cisco Systems, Compaq Computer, Microsoft and of Intel.</p><p>TUCKER: Let us go back down to Wall Street now to our money team, Rhonda Schaffler is standing watch over the New York Stock Exchange, and Charles is guarding the doors at the Nasdaq.</p><p>But let's begin with Rhonda.</p><p>Rhonda, what is the word down on the floor?</p><p>SCHAFFLER: Bill, they like these Dow stocks today.  We are seeing a strong advance in financials and drug stocks, the entire sector getting a boost on that J.P. Morgan overweight, and also a strategist at Merrill recommending some of these the old-economy stock, and we are seeing a move into cyclical and financials.  We had a merger as well, and that's helping boost the entire sector, stocks like American Express, for instance, up about 3 1/2, brokerage stocks doing well, Lehman and Goldman Sachs leading the way there.</p><p>And earnings watch is focusing on Motorola.  Most techs are down, that one is down too, but only fractionally so, a investors awaits its earnings report.  It is considered a bellwether company -- Charles.</p><p>MOLINEAUX: Well, thanks, Rhonda, we are looking a -- actually a negative picture on the Nasdaq, we have seen a couple of attempted rallies for technology stocks, and so far, none of them have stuck.</p><p>Take a look at what they are doing, the industries traded on the Nasdaq are mixed.  Industrial stocks are actually down by a good one percent, insurance stocks are weak, as are telecom, as well as computers.  So we got financials are up, banking stocks are up, transports are up, and biotechnology stocks, which have been one of the most volatile sectors in the past two weeks are also gaining on the day today.</p><p>Earnings are expected to be a major component of the outlook for tech stocks and the Nasdaq this week.  After the close, we are going to hear from Motorola over on the New York Stock Exchange, and Biogen, a major big-cap bellwether among the biotechnology stocks.</p><p>But tech stocks, as a group, were getting some very bad karma thrown at them from Merrill Lynch.  As Terry mentioned, Richard McCabe at Merrill says the market is headed into a significance rotation out of tech stocks.  He says last week's wild swings weren't a brief, random event, but the beginning of a longer lasting change.  He says, rather than buying on the dips, as they have for years, tech investors should now be selling in the rallies, as they reduce their exposure to tech.  He expects a lot of weakness, especially in the most popular tech stocks -- Bill, Terry.</p><p>KEENAN: OK, thanks, Charles.</p><p>Well, everyday in our \"Stock of the Day\" segment, we ask you which stocks we should but for our IN THE MONEY portfolio.  ON Friday, we asked you to do a little spring cleaning and tell us which stocks should sell.  And we know have the results from this weekend's on-line portfolio review.  We are selling the stocks that more than 30 percent of you voted to dump.  And we had a pretty large response.</p><p>The top choice, Harley-Davidson, which we will sell for 16 percent profit.  Other top vote-getters: McDonald's, which hasn't moved much since we bought, and it is out of the portfolio.  And Earthlink, which we take a big hit on, down over 40 percent from where we bought that stock.</p><p>We are also going to sell Excite@home for a small loss, that is a pretty recent edition to our portfolio. The others being ditched: Lycos and Pepsico. We will make a six percent profit on both of those. And Ameritrade, it is up 17 percent since we bought it in February, it is also being axed -- tough crowd here. And Daimlerchrysler, the automotive giant, that stock has not done anything since we bought it a month ago, so it is getting kicked out as well. </p><p>TUCKER: The only thing that concerned me when I was reviewing the list is that, you know, just at the time when we got a lot of people are saying you need to go into some of those industry groups, you need to, you know, reduce your exposure to technology, we are dumping Harley-Davidson, which I admit is a sentimental favorite of mine\u2026</p><p>KEENAN: It is.</p><p>TUCKER: \u2026 but you are also dumping Pepsi, as well, and moving out of there, and McDonald's, which is an interesting choice.</p><p>KEENAN: Some of the consumer staples, which we know a lot of people on Wall Street have been recommending in the last couple of weeks as a safe place to park some money, our viewers don't like it. And I noticed, you know, there's a lot of Internet names that did not get kicked out, despite the fact\u2026</p><p>TUCKER: It is the biggest group, in fact, that is in the portfolio, Terry, are the Internet names.</p><p>KEENAN: Yes, and a lot of those, America Online, Yahoo!, CMGI, Adobe, Ariba, all in our portfolio, and they did not get kicked out.</p><p>TUCKER: Well, it is interesting that the business to business did not get kicked out, but we still are clinging on to VerticalNet and Ariba, because we are going to start talking about the B2B group in just a second here.</p><p>In fact, one sector in our portfolio is business to business stocks, and maybe that is a good thing that we don't have more than two.  Safeguard Security, \"one of the leading Web company incubators,\" in quotes, says it will stop investing in business-to-business Internet companies.</p><p>KEENAN: Yes, instead, it says it will focus more on Internet infrastructure companies.</p><p>Joining us from Philadelphia to explain this shift is the company's president, Henry Wallaesa.</p><p>Mr. Wallaesa, welcome.  Tell us why you lost interest in the B2B stocks because they, of course, have been all the rage this year. HENRY WALLAESA, PRES. &amp; COO, SAFEGUARD SCIENTIFICS: well, thank you, It is the rage.  In fact, we seem to have a little bit of controversy there.  We have not abandoned the B2B space, in fact, most of our holdings are in the B2B space, including our important asset which is Internet Capital Group.  We incubator Internet Capital Group on our campus all the back to 1995, and we have a huge belief that B2B e-commerce is something that we will hold into the future.  We are certainly going to hold our position in Internet Capital Group.</p><p>The change that we are making is basically to sharpen our focus on Internet infrastructure because the market is so huge.  It is largely untapped, and we think that we have a terrific opportunity for our shareholders.</p><p>TUCKER: And just so people didn't confuse you with a chicken hatcher, when you talk about incubate, you are talking of course providing the funding for these company and nurturing them along with funding and I probably some managerial direction, as well.</p><p>If you are losing interest in B2B because its valuations have increased so much, where are you looking now?  What areas intrigue you the most?</p><p>WALLAESA: Well, actually, we haven't lost interest in B2B, we don't think that the valuations are too high.  But we are interested in communications, software, and e-services, in particular in communications we love wireless, we also like broadband, and we have made a number of key acquisitions in both of those areas.  We also acquired a company called Web Telecom because we like voiceover IP. Software space we really like.  The integration of Internet applications, along with legacy applications.  We like the ASP space in the services sector.</p><p>So there are a lot of places where we are acquiring some very exciting companies and we think that we have an exciting future for Safeguard.</p><p>KEENAN: When do you think the big companies, big traditional companies, the GEs of the world, are really going to get into the business to business space, and do you think that they will come to dominate it at the expense of companies such as VerticalNet?</p><p>WALLAESA: I think that the big companies are already into B2B e- commerce.  Most of the networks that are out there are EDI based rather than IP based, but I believe that they will be working with companies like VerticalNet and Internet Capital Group to have those kind of capabilities for the future.</p><p>We think that Internet Capital Group and its market maker in a box offers people the ability to move swiftly into the Internet-based B2B commerce area.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, Henry Wallaesa, thank you very much for being our guest on IN THE MONEY.  And for those of you who are curious, his stock does trade, it trades on the Big Board, under the tucker SFE. It is making a nice move today.  It is better than $4 a share to 63 and change.</p><p>Still to come on IN THE MONEY: They say what goes up, must come down.  Is that the case with gas prices?  We'll check.</p><p>KEENAN: Plus, she's known in the financial world as a top market maven.  Now, she's out with a book on how you can invest using the basics.  Mary Farrell will join us.</p><p>TUCKER: Plus, could Asia be the next boom for the on-line brokers? and why you might to look East to make some investments. That is next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>TUCKER: All right, take here a live shot of the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.  Best performing sector last week: transportation sector.  It was up 2.3 percent, but airlines were up strongly again today.  Look at that move by Delta, up 2 1/8.  UAL is up 1.  In fact, the transportation index today at the Dow is up 52 points.  That is a gain, Terry, of nearly 2 percent.</p><p>KEENAN: People who have invested in those stocks probably saying, it is about time, because they've been in a bear market for a couple years now.</p><p>TUCKER: Yes, they have.  And most people who are invested in those stocks, you should know, on Wall Street call them not investing stocks but trading stocks, so\u2026</p><p>KEENAN: OK, well, time now to check some of the other stories making news today.</p><p>And for that, we go back to Bill Hemmer in Atlanta with the latest -- Bill.</p><p>HEMMER: Bill and Terry, thanks again.  You just mentioned the airline companies.  Today, the quality of service among the nation's largest airlines appears to be getting worse.  According to a university study that was released today, airlines received failing grades when it came to on-time arrivals, bumping and passenger complaints.  This despite a promise last year to actually improve service.  The only area to show a slight improvement was baggage handling.  Of the 10 major air carriers surveyed, Southwest Airlines showed the best performance, according to that study.</p><p>The sharp rise in gasoline prices may have topped out.  A Lundberg survey shows the average price for self-serve regular is now $1.57 a gallon.  That's down 2 1/2 cents in the past two weeks. Experts say it's the biggest drop since December of 1998 and largely due to OPEC's decision to boost crude oil production.  Gas prices are expected to keep falling in the coming months.</p><p>Machinists at Lockheed Martin's Fort Worth, Texas plant are on strike.  Nearly 2,300 union workers walked off the job last night. This after a breakdown in contract negotiations.  The union workers are demanding better wages and better benefits.  No new talks have been scheduled.  A Lockheed Spokesman says all of the plant's employees are expected to report to work today.</p><p>That's a quick update of news headlines.  Now back to New York once again with Bill and Terry and more financial news.</p><p>TUCKER: Thanks, Bill.</p><p>KEENAN: Thanks, Bill.</p><p>OK, in our \"E-World\" segment today, we're looking at what could be a new frontier for the new economy.  The popularity of online trading is exploding in Asia.  Brokerage company stocks could reap many of the rewards of this latest craze in the Orient.</p><p>As Lian Pek explains, that could open the door to big investment opportunities for U.S. investors.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LIAN PEK, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Getting on the phone to your broker is still how most people in Asia trade stocks.  But increasingly, the buy or sell order is just a mouse click away.</p><p>LANE LESKELA, GARTNER GROUP: The rate of growth of new online brokerage is quite phenomenon.  In fact, by 2002, we actually expect that about 70 percent of all brokerages operating in markets like Australia, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore will actually offer online trading.</p><p>PEK: South Korea is a case in point: Nearly 45 percent of retail trading is done through the Net.  That's the highest cyber- trading penetration rate in the world.  Even higher than that of the United States.</p><p>MARK DUFF, CEO, BOOM SECURITIES: The U.S. market took, really, between three and five years to evolve.  We're seeing in Asia countries making the same evolutionary curve or adoption in a matter of six to nine months.</p><p>PEK: Not surprisingly, big-name U.S. brokers are flocking to the region.  E*Trade is already muscling in on the lucrative Japanese market with E*Trade Japan, while Charles Schwab, America's largest e- broker, and second place TD Waterhouse, have started trading Hong Kong Shares.</p><p>KAREN BUCK, TD WATERHOUSE: One of the benefits that we will see of online trading, particularly here in Hong Kong as commissions are deregulated and straight-through processing takes place is that more firms will come into the market.  We'll see a greater online penetration and customers will start to trade online, and also through wireless channels.</p><p>PEK: It's a growing industry, no doubt, but is there room enough for all?  Boom Securities, the only pure online startup in Hong Kong, says local brokers are going for a different slice of the pie from their international counterparts. DUFF: The challenge to those institutions are the Merrill Lynches, Morgan Stanleys that have been out here for 15 to 20 years. They are, from our perspective, battling it out at 30,000 feet for the highest-income client.  We're not in that bracket.  We are a consumer product for a middle-income investor.</p><p>PEK: Even if there is enough business to go around, barriers to growth remain.  Many countries sill have fixed commissions, and only a handful like Korea, Japan and Taiwan enjoy flexible rates.</p><p>(on camera): And when the regulating environment does eventually ease up, many predict the online floodgates should open.  Not only will brokers get a better shot at those cyberspace profits, investors can also start trading for themselves, which means day-trading could become the next big thing in Asia.</p><p>Lian Pek, CNN Financial News, Hong Kong.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>KEENAN: OK, let's take a look at how the online brokers are doing this morning.  We have -- there you see a rally pretty much across the board, National Discount up 1 7/16, as is Charles Schwab. Fractional moves for E*Trade and DLJ Direct.  And we have a big move for TD Waterhouse, as you can see there, Goldman Sachs adding that stock to its recommended list this morning.</p><p>TUCKER: There are, of course, many other things you can do online besides just trade.  You can also pay your bills online.  And we're going to take a look at paying your bills online in today's \"E- World.\"</p><p>Several financial institutions now offer this service to clients. With a look at the options and the advantages of online bill-paying, we're joined now by Kelly Smith.  She is the money editor for Time Warner's new monthly magazine called \"Real Simple.\"</p><p>And welcome.</p><p>KELLY SMITH, MONEY EDITOR, \"REAL SIMPLE\": Good morning.</p><p>TUCKER: Good morning to you.</p><p>What is the deal here?  And I ask with something of a personal interest because I've been looking at all of these various services. And one of the first things that comes to my mind is, are these services reliable and secure?</p><p>SMITH: Well, that's a big concern for a lot of people.  I think a lot of people are intrigued by the idea of being able to simplify a task that's very time-consuming and reduce it down to 10 minutes.  But privacy is a big issue.  And so what you need to do, whether you're paying bills online through your bank or through one of the Internet bill-paying services that specializes in this in particular, you need to pay attention to what their stated privacy policy is.  A lot of the banks will, you know, say that they will not share your direct information, but that they can share the information on how you use your banking account with their internal services to market products to you or services within the bank.</p><p>A lot of the Internet bill-paying services say that they won't share any information that can be traced directly to your customer account with anybody, whether it's in dealing with companies that they work with or trading lists or selling lists.  Anything like that.</p><p>TUCKER: What about that difference between the bank and an online bill-paying service.  Is one better than the other?  Or how do you choose one?</p><p>SMITH: It depends on what kind of services you want.  If you have a regular checking account with a bank, then it's fairly easy to set up a bill-paying online account with your bank.  Basically, what you have to do is give them the names of your creditors and your account numbers and they will send -- when you get the bills each month, then you can direct your bank to pay those bills.  You don't have to worry about stamps, you don't have to worry about making a trip to the post office.</p><p>But what the Internet bill-paying services like PayMyBills.com or StatusFactory or Paytrust.com, what they do is reroute your bills to them directly so you never actually get a paper bill.  They'll send you an e-mail when your bill has arrived and you can either see a copy of it scanned in online and then direct the service to pay it or pay a portion of it or hold off.</p><p>TUCKER: What about fees?</p><p>SMITH: Well, these are actually very affordable.  They can cost anywhere from nothing to about $10 for between 25 and 30 transactions a month.</p><p>TUCKER: All right, Kelly.</p><p>Kelly Smith.  She is the editor of Time Warner's new magazine, \"Real Simple.\"</p><p>Thank you for being here and being our guest on IN THE MONEY.</p><p>SMITH: You're welcome.</p><p>TUCKER: Now just ahead on IN THE MONEY, we're going to take a look at the markets.  And PaineWebber's investment strategist Mary Farrell will be here to help you plan your stock investment strategies.</p><p>KEENAN: We're going to talk to her about her new book, up next.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>KEENAN: You are looking at a live pictures of the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, we are at our highs of the day for the Dow. Financial stocks and the pharmaceuticals are red hot this morning.  We are seeing some selling in shares Hewlett Packard, though, that stock is down three.</p><p>TUCKER: Here on IN THE MONEY, we are always on the lookout for smart investment ideas that will help you make money.  In today's \"Moneywise\" segment, we go beyond the basics with Mary Farrell.</p><p>KEENAN: You may know her as a top investment strategist for PaineWebber, she is a familiar face, she's been a regular guest here on IN THE MONEY talking about the markets and how you should invest. Today, she's joining us to talk about her book, \"Beyond the Basics: How to Invest Your Money, Now That You Know a Thing or Two.\"</p><p>And Mary, welcome to IN THE MONEY.  If you are an investor who knows a thing or two, but you know hasn't really be in the market for a long time, what's the most important thing that you should be doing right now?</p><p>MARY FARRELL, AUTHOR, \"BEYOND THE BASICS\": I think you really need to establish a financial plan, and that was why I wrote the book is the fact, while nearly 50 percent of Americans own stocks or mutual funds, but that is not the same as achieving your investment goals. You need to have both.</p><p>TUCKER: Well, we got a full screen of your basics, let's start with: \"I know a thing or two\" basics here and take a look at what we need to do.  In the first thing you have up here, if you explain it to me, because I don't understand it, it is time in the market.  What does that mean?</p><p>FARRELL: Well, I think we've seen a lot, particularly with a very volatile market, a lot of trading in and out of the market, and people are trying to be market timers to not get clinked by this volatility.  But the real key to success is really time in the market. And I think very few investors, if any, can time the market successfully over time.  So one of my strong recommendations is: Buy good quality companies that you are happy with over a multiyear period and hold on to them.</p><p>KEENAN: And what we've also learned in the market in the last couple of weeks is the virtues of diversification, right?  And that is also one of your tips.</p><p>FARRELL: Yes, absolutely, and anyone who happened to own Internet stocks the last few weeks would realize why you should be diversified.  But I think that's really important for investors, is certainly you want to have a chunk of technology, but you want to be sure that you are represented in a number of other areas, and that you should probably have some bonds, too, to be sure that you are not on the wrong side of the trend in the market.</p><p>TUCKER: One of my favorites of yours, in terms of advice, is once we have gotten beyond the basics is the \"swan theory.\"</p><p>FARRELL: I had heard that expression at Swan Funds, and it is Sleep Well at Night Funds.  But I think it is important because investors really need to assess their risk tolerance.  You know, some investors can be 100 percent invested in technology stocks, be happy about it, ignore when they see Nasdaq moving a thousand points in a day, but there are some investors who can't sleep at night with that kind of investment, and they need to really structure a portfolio they are happy with.</p><p>KEENAN: One of your other \"Beyond the Basics\" there is to learn to pick stocks.  That's not so easy.  How do you start the process?</p><p>FARRELL: One thing I talk about extensively is what I call \"thematic investing,\" because there a lot of things we don't know about what is going to happen.  We don't know where the market is going to close this week or this month, but there is things we do know.  We know technology is leading the economy.  We know we are in an American age of affluence, where the baby boomers are in their peak spending years.  So let's invest on the things we know, have that theme.  And then, when you pick a stock, there's no shortcuts, you have to understand the company, why you are buying it, understand their competitors, and really make a fundamental assessment of what their earnings growth is going to be.</p><p>TUCKER: Once you know a thing or two, you know a thing two or three, and I'm wondering where interest rates come into this picture because we have Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan determined to make interest rates part of our consciousness at least.</p><p>FARRELL: And that's part of the process of education.  In some ways, we've been very fortunate because this has been the most extraordinary bull market in history, and I think that's immunized people to the potential risks you have, if interest rates rise.  You know, we have been declining rates since '82, so now that's firmly in place.  But if they started rising again, that would certainly mean you would have to invest differently.</p><p>Fortunately, I think, even though they backed up a bit, I think the long-term trend remains in place that they will continue moving down.</p><p>KEENAN: And when it comes to mutual funds, you are not an overwhelming proponent of mutual funds.  Do you believe that you should use them when you get your investment goals accomplished elsewhere, right?</p><p>FARRELL: I think there is very strategic uses for mutual funds, and one of the best uses -- you know, so many people are afraid to take that initial plunge into the market because they don't have enough money for a diversified portfolio, you are buying a diversified portfolio with professional management when you buy a mutual funds at a very cheap price.  I think it is a great way to start the market.</p><p>And then a great way to give you participation.  If you want to buy foreign stocks, for example, it's very difficult for an individual to buy foreign stocks directly, a fund can give you that, or if you want exposure in a particular sector.</p><p>And then there is group of people who really don't want to invest the time or effort to be involved with their portfolio, and then a good balanced fund is a good way for them to get that professional management.</p><p>TUCKER: With these markets like they've been lately, Mary, what do you make of them?  Are we just in a hiccup here or are we OK?</p><p>FARRELL: I think, unfortunately, we are going to continue to see this volatility, and part of the problem is that we do have these day traders chasing momentum, that tends to exacerbate the move, you have the on-line traders who trade very quickly and cheaply, and studies show they trade more often.  So i think you are going to see these bounces moving around.</p><p>I think the important thing is, it doesn't change the long-term trend.  You know, when you are buying a company, you are buying a future stream of earnings, and that usually is not affected by the short-term volatility.</p><p>TUCKER: Excellent, Mary, thank you very much.</p><p>KEENAN: Thanks, Mary, congratulations on the book.</p><p>FARRELL: Thank you.</p><p>KEENAN: Mary Farrell.</p><p>That does it for today's edition of IN THE MONEY.  Thanks for watching.  I'm Terry Keenan.</p><p>TUCKER: We'll see you tomorrow.</p><p>TO ORDER A VIDEO OF THIS TRANSCRIPT, PLEASE CALL 800-CNN-NEWS OR USE OUR SECURE ONLINE ORDER FORM LOCATED AT <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.fdch.com\">www.fdch.com</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNN2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:400W-Y7Y0-009B-G1S3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">271063</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"8416\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>CNN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>April 10, 2000;

Wall Street today wrapping up its busiest week ever - a stunning 5-1/2 billion shares were traded on the big board and the NASDAQ this week.  It was also a week of wild price swings although today the direction was decidedly lower, continued weakness in technology issues and concerns about corporate profits once again moving into the marketplace to hurt stock prices.  At the close tonight, the Dow Jones Industrials 5,426.82, a loss of 37.36 on the day.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Big board volume slowed to 408 million shares despite double witching, exploration of options and futures.  For the week, the Dow Jones Industrials down a modest 83.74.  The NASDAQ fell 12.14 today after surging 56 points over the past two days.  The volume on the NASDAQ - 531 million shares, almost 532 million.  And bond prices losing ground after yesterday's big run up.  The 30-year bond lost more than half a point in price today and the yield rose to 6.97 percent.  Not exactly a dull summer so far on Wall Street.  Greg Clarkin has been following the market mayhem and is here tonight with a report.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GREG CLARKIN, CNN Financial News Correspondent: Well, Lou, as the market as week that Roth Walsh did.  Records were shattered.  Investor confidence was robbed and when the dust cleared, investor wanted to know if the turmoil was really over.</p><p>From the Chicago's Future's pits to the New York Stock Exchange, it was a week of worry in the markets and resignation among average investors.<br/>\u00a0<br/>1st MARKET INVESTOR: I'm not nervous about it.  I just think it's a natural thing that happens in a market.<br/>\u00a0<br/>2nd MARKET INVESTOR: I don't get nervous.  In the long run everything- if the economy is good, the market will be good.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GREG CLARKIN: A 161-point loss on the Dow on Monday was followed by a whipsaw session Tuesday when a record billion-and-a-half shares traded on the NYSE and NASDAQ and the Dow swung from a 167-point loss to a slight gain.<br/>\u00a0<br/>RICHARD GRASSO, Chairman, NYSE: This is our most active week in our history.  We'll trade 2.4 and a fraction billion shares and that, of course, for us a few short years ago was a great year.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GREG CLARKIN: Four earnings reports triggered the selling and sparked fears that the long-running bull market had stalled.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GAIL DUDACK, Chief Investment Strategist, UBS Securities: It's very obvious that corporate earnings for the S&amp;P will not be better than that GDP growth that we're seeing.  And that, I think, is the big surprise on the earning's front.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GREG CLARKIN: But the sell off blew off by week's end.  Solid earnings from NASDAQ bell weather Intel helped restore stability and investor confidence.  Stocks soared late in the week but never recovered completely.  Some said the market moved through a quick correction.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LARRY RICE, Chief Market Strategist, Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross: I think we're very close to the end of this particular correction.  The bull market is not over by any means.  You need several increases in interest rates before stocks top out.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GREG CLARKIN: And the Federal Reserve chairman gave investors hope Thursday that a rate hike will not come soon.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Now, market optimists may say that all this selling has created a bargain-hunter's paradise.  But, Lou, there are plenty of market pros who will tell that there are still companies that over-valued stocks and that their primed for a fall.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: So, we've got some over-valued and under-valued.<br/>\u00a0<br/>GREG CLARKIN: Exactly.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Sounds like a market.  All right, Greg.  Thanks.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Well, as we reported, technology stocks today pulled back.  The next big tech report comes Monday after the close when Microsoft posts its second-quarter results.<br/>\u00a0<br/>RICK SHERLUND, Technology Analyst, Goldman Sachs: Microsoft is having a very good quarter.  We're looking for revenues up about 35 percent and I think it could be a little better than that possibly.  So, I think we'll see very good results from Microsoft.  What will be most important is the commentary, what the outlook is for the second half of this year.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Microsoft today moving up almost 1-1/8 ahead of that earnings report and among other techs whose results simply weren't enough for this street, I-Omega [sp] today tumbling five-and-a-half dollars a share, losing almost 20 percent of its price, 18 million shares were traded; that despite a five-fold surge and quarterly revenue.  Some microsystems down almost three-and-a-half dollars.  Netscape [sp] down three and a half.<br/>\u00a0<br/>FTC Forced to Rethink Its Role as Telecom Changes<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS, Anchor: Another step forward tonight, however, for the merger of Time Warner and CNN's parent company Turner Broadcasting.  The FTC has told its staff to draft a final-consent order that would clear the deal.  Commissioners will formally vote when that draft is complete.  That's expected within the next three weeks.  Kelli Arena is in Washington and has the story for us.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KELLI ARENA, Correspondent: The Federal Trade Commission does not welcome a lot of attention.  But its been closely watched during the Turner-Time Warner merger process.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Antitrust lawyers and merger experts say they were most impressed at how the FTC showed a great deal of flexibility.  With the passage of the Telecommunications Act, observers say it's vital that the FTC carves out a role for itself.<br/>\u00a0<br/>SCOTT CLELAND, Telecommunications Analyst, Washington Research Group: Without a doubt, the 1996 Telecom Act has by far a larger impact on the media industry than this deal.  I would say this deal is the gnat on the back of- on the Telecom Act.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KELLI ARENA: As a result, veteran FTC watchers say they sense a 'C-change' at the agency.  In an effort to remain an important player in media mergers, the FTC seems to have set aside its prosecutorial role, preferring instead to be more of a regulator.  An example, the agency's detailed restructuring of the Time Warner-TBS deal.<br/>\u00a0<br/>DAVID DONOHOE, Antitrust Attorney: The idea of having fairly elaborate regulatory solutions is something which I think has been used much more frequently in the last two or three years than it had been before.<br/>\u00a0<br/>KELLI ARENA: Much of the credit for the transition is given to the FTC's chairman Robert Petovsky [sp] who was described as a mastermind when it comes to antitrust issues.<br/>\u00a0<br/>He also has a keen interest in media issues which could mean that the FTC will end up playing a larger role than the Justice Department in future media cases.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Kelli Arena, CNN Financial News, Washington.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Well, Archer, Daniels, Midland tonight has cleared on legal hurdle.  A federal judge in Chicago tonight has approved a $45 million settlement of a class action law suit brought against ADM.  The company had been accused of fixing the price of Lycine [sp], a feed additive.  ADM officials still face possible criminal charges in that case.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Quaker announcing a management shake up at its faltering Snapple beverage unit, a three-man team replacing the unit's president Donald Uzzi [sp] who is leaving the company.  This new team of managers to report directly to Quaker chairman William Smithburg.  Quaker running into nothing but trouble since paying $1.7 billion for Snapple back in 1994.<br/>\u00a0<br/>A major executive change triggering a stunning rally in Sunbeam shares.  Sunbeam stock up 24 percent in price today, gaining 6-1/8 a share.  Investors euphoric about the company's choice for chairman and chief executive officer.  Sunbeam hired cost-cutter with Ampier [sp] Albert Dunlap to boost it's lodging earnings and performance.  The former chief executive office of Scott Paper revived that company with sweeping job cuts earning the title 'Chainsaw Al.' Dunlap pocketed $100 million when Scott was sold to Kimberly-Clark last year and Dunlap isn't doing too badly in his first full day at Sunbeam.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Dunlap yesterday bought three million shares of Sunbeam and that has netted him a profit of $1.6 million with that $6.00 surge in the price of Sunbeam shares.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Well, coming up next here on Moneyline we'll take a closer look at the day's activity on Wall Street - the big losers, the winners and the rising level of insider sales.  What does it mean to top executives all over the countries dumping shares into their companies.  We'll take a look at the reasons why.  Stay with us.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Insider Selling at Record High Levels, Worrying Some<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS, Anchor: Well, a volatile week on Wall Street, and today tech stocks pulled back from what has been a two-day rally.  The Dow tonight at 5426.82, down 37.36 on the day.  For the week, down almost 84 points, and it didn't seem possible that it could do that well as the week began.  Volume 408 million shares.  Declining issues today beat out advancers by a three-to-two margin.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The Composite fell 2.19, the S&amp;P 500 down 4.83.  And, with the airline sector down sharply, the Dow transports fell 13.13 and the utilities, on a modestly weaker bond market, falling significantly - down 1.89.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The Nasdaq Composite - 1097.68 at the close, losing 12.14.  The Nasdaq this week, after all of the dust and smoke had settled, losing only six points.  Almost 532 million shares were traded today.  Decliners beat advancers on the Nasdaq by almost 400 shares today.  The American Exchange Composite - 548.76 at the close of business, losing 2.87 and volume more than 19 million shares.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Tonight's moneyline movers led by Delta, which dropped 2 1/8th.  Fourth quarter earnings down 36 percent.  That because of a one-time charge to pay for its early retirement program.  Without that charge, profits would have risen 31 percent.<br/>\u00a0<br/>America Online gained $2.75 a share.  America Online says it expects to at least double fourth quarter earnings.  Amgen gaining almost a dollar a share.  Second quarter profits there up 30 percent.  Amgen also expecting double-digit sales growth over the next few years.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Gillette gained $2.50 today.  Second quarter earnings of<br/>\u00a0<br/>Gillette up 19 percent.  The company also acquiring a Russian razor maker.  The terms of the deal were not disclosed.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Invision Technologies surged 4 1/8th.  The company makes a machine called CTX-5000, which detects explosive devices in luggage.  That stock moving up, following the devastating TWA crash Wednesday.  Second quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street expectations.  Flouriscan [sp] Imaging Systems surging 2 7/8th or 37 percent.  Hollogic [sp] acquiring the x-ray equipment maker.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In other corporate news, General Mills- General Mills launching two low-fat breakfast cereals under the Betty Crocker brand name.  Betty Crocker, of course, best known for cakes and other desserts.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Roadmaster Industries selling its bicycle and Flexible Flyers sled business to Brunswick.  The price - $212 million.  And, Ryder hiring Golden-Sachs to explore the sale of its consumer truck rental unit.  Ryder today gained 5/8ths.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Not everyone was caught off guard when the stock markets lurched lower earlier this week.  Insider trading- insider selling, rather, or the selling by senior executives, has risen sharply over the past few weeks.  Some analysts say that's a sign the market could be headed lower.  Sean Callebs has the report.<br/>\u00a0<br/>SEAN CALLEBS, Correspondent: America Online, Micron [sp] Tech, Seagate [sp], Filenet [sp], Sunglass [unintelligible] International and Bright Point [sp] - all companies that took a beating in the big sell-off.  But, some officers of those companies apparently escaped before the fall.  Analysts following insider deals report an unusually high amount of selling over the past several weeks.<br/>\u00a0<br/>DAVID COLEMAN, Vickers Weekly, Insider Report: Patterns of executives and directors are often telling indicators to a stock's future performance.  The management of a company is- are the individuals who are down in the trenches and the best indicator that I've ever seen.<br/>\u00a0<br/>SEAN CALLEBS: Officers buying and selling chunks of their stock must file reports with the government.  Often executives sell when they believe the price has topped out, or when future earnings prospects may be poor.  And, those sales are at a record level.  Analysts who track inside selling say that since the start of the year, insiders are selling stocks more than twice as often as other insiders are buying.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LARRY RICE, Investment Strategist, Josephthal Lyon &amp; Ross: You've got the end of the bull market.  Whether you're in the 7th inning or the 8th inning, you're late in the game.  But, certainly the bear market has not begun, but we're in this corrective phase.<br/>\u00a0<br/>SEAN CALLEBS: Analysts say insider selling is broad-based, in industries from data processing to automotive manufacturing.  And, they say, the only really insider buying going on right now is in real estate.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The selling trend doesn't necessarily mean that a bear market is just around the corner.  Experts caution that insiders sell for a number of reasons - sometimes they just need the money.  But, a trend of this magnitude does have some analysts concerned that the correction isn't over just yet.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Sean Callebs, CNN Financial News, New York.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Westinghouse today announcing plans - very sketchy plans - to launch what they are terming 'a news-related cable channel.' Westinghouse Chairman Michael Jordan, says the channel will be, 'news-related, but not a news channel'.  A lot of executives at a number of networks are trying to figure out exactly what that means tonight.  Westinghouse shares today down 50 cents.  Westinghouse closed at 17 1/8th.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In announcing those plans late today, Jordan stressed he has no interest in the movie business.  Jordan saying, 'You might as well go to Las Vegas.'<br/>\u00a0<br/>Coming up next here on Moneyline, a whirlwind of a week in the markets.  We'll have one of the country's top strategist telling us what it all means and what we can expect.  My guest tonight is Bill Dodge of Marvin &amp; Palmer.  Stay with us.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Dodge Recommends International Market Investments<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS, Anchor: Well, a relatively quiet ending to what has been at least a stomach churning week on Wall Street.  Joining me now to put the week's price swings in perspective is Bill Dodge, Chief Investment Strategist at Marvin &amp; Palmer.  Bill oversees, by the way, $3.5 billion at the global money management firm.  Good to have you with us.<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE, Chief Investment Strategist, Marvin &amp; Palmer: Good to be here.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Now, let me ask you, you know, when you look at the- the Nasdaq only losing six points on the week after the way we began, I- are you as surprised as I am that that's the size of the swing?<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: Yeah, I'm surprised at the volatility.  I'm surprised we came back as quickly as we did, and, yet, I'm not.  In the context that the- the money flows are still strong into mutual funds, and that's the real key to what's been going and what's going to happen.  So, the buying power continues to come in.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: The buying power is there.  Is this volatility at an end, are we watching its ebb, or what can we expect?<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: I think we're going to stay in a rather tight 5-600 point trading range.  It's going to be volatile.  It's going to be tough for the U.S. market to- to perform like it has in the last few years.  And, I would not expect it to break out to the upside in a major move here throughout the year, frankly, although we can trade back towards 57 or 58 hundred.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Now, a lot of people, as you know, are talking about a fundamental shift in investor psychology here.  We've gone from concerns about inflation and an overheated economy to concerns about a lack of earnings and the prospect of recession.  Tell us what you think.<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: Well, money flows dropped from $25 billion last- in May to $15 in June.  It's all over.  It has to have peaked.  Well, the bottom line is this has been driven by generational demographics and a profound change in the competitive position of U.S. corporations, as exports have risen from five percent of GDP to nearly 20 percent of GDP.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Both those fundamental trends are still in place.  Particularly, the generational demographics have another 10 years to go, and so I think this bull market's got a lot left in it.  From a longer term- point of view, this is not the end of this secular or great disinflation bull market by any means at all.  It's taken a time out after a period of going hyperbolic, I think is what the press liked to call it last year.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Well, we have seen some stunning gains.  I mean, we're still up significantly on these indexes despite all of the volatility and downside moves over the last two weeks.  You- you think this correction is at an end?<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: I think the-<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Is this a correction?  I guess I should first start out - is this a correction?<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: Well, sure, it is.  Absolutely qualifies for an intermediate term, a minor correction.  It's not a severe correction.  I think it could get to the 12-13 percent level.  I would say 5000 on the Dow, 1000 on the Nasdaq Composite, 600 on the S&amp;P could be the low.  We may have- we may have seen it.<br/>\u00a0<br/>We're not going to straight up.  Today's, you know, clear indication of that.  We're going to repair the damage.  The psychology has been broken.  There's been some pocketbooks broken in the aggressive growth areas, and people are going to search around, I think, for new places to- to put their money.  It's going to keep coming in though.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: That- that money, that liquidity-<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: Yeah.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: -is critically important, irrespective of the- of the fundamentals.<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: Absolutely.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: But, the- Sean Callebs just did the report on inside-<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: Right.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: -insider selling.  How important is that to you in your evaluation of the market?<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: Well, it can be- I think it can be very important at the company level.  At major turning points, I suppose it can be extreme and be indicative of a trend.  But, we always will have to keep in mind that over the past five or 10 years, stock options and stock incentive programs, of one form or another, have become a major portion of CEO and senior management and middle management - and farther down in the corporation, frankly - compensation.  Incentive compensation is a- is a major factor that will influence insiders selling from time to time.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: So, you don't see this as particularly pronounced or indicative of much at this point?<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: No, I don't.  I- I really don't.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Now, you talked about where we put our money.  Let's- let's talk about where we put our money.  What do we do?  Is this a market in which to invest?<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: Well, the trouble the market has is interest rates.  The U.S. economy and the rest of the major economies - Japan and Germany in particular - are starting to grow.  We haven't had that happen for a decade.  That means interest rates are going to be pressured over the next year, year-and-a-half or maybe two years.  So, you want to find things that are going to do well from an earnings point of view - that's U.S. industrials.<br/>\u00a0<br/>And, I think, frankly, if you're looking for value and maybe relative growth over the next couple years, it's probably in the foreign markets.  In emerging markets you can get almost- You're paying almost twice as much in the U.S. for a unit of growth, for example, in emerging markets and almost 40 percent more in those international markets that are not really the emerging markets.  So, I think there's a shift that's begun and this is a good time for U.S. investors to add to that international allocation, frankly.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: And, the two past two weeks in U.S. markets has been a pretty good pre-conditioner and training ground for investment in some of those sometimes very volatile emerging markets.<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: We've had one heck of a five-year relative run for the U.S. market, and I think, yes, people are starting to say maybe we should be looking elsewhere.  Yes.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: All right.  Bill Dodge, as always, great to have you with us.<br/>\u00a0<br/>BILL DODGE: Thank you.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: Come back soon.  Well, coming up next here on Moneyline - let the marketing games begin.  Two rival sneaker makers shell out lots of money in a battle for Olympic gold.  Stay with us.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Nike Engages in Ambush Advertising of Olympian Size<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS, Anchor: In Atlanta tonight, opening ceremonies for the Summer Olympics.  The games begin tomorrow.  A fierce marketing battle is already underway.  Reebok, an official Olympic sponsor pitted against Nike, which has literally ambushed its way into the Olympic Games.  Rhonda Schaeffler has the story.<br/>\u00a0<br/>RHONDA SCHAEFFLER, Correspondent: Atlanta's been inundated by athletes, tourists and a Nike Swoosh.  It's on billboards, on a specially-constructed Nike building overlooking the Olympic Park, not to mention on the hearts and soles of thousands of Olympic competitors.  Never Mind that Nike is not the official Olympic footwear supplier.  Reebok is.<br/>\u00a0<br/>SEAN BRENNER, Editor, Team Marketing Report: As far as whether it's going to hurt Reebok- it will certainly take some of the attention away that Reebok could have gotten.<br/>\u00a0<br/>RHONDA SCHAEFFLER: Nike is going for the gold in a new unsanctioned event - ambush marketing, associating itself with the Summer Games even though it has no official Olympic role.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Reebok paid $20 million for the right to advertise during network Olympic coverage.  Nike counters with a blitz of ads outside Olympic coverage.  Nike can't use the word Olympics, but its ad showcased top Olympic athletes like Carl Lewis.  Nike easily outsells Reebok the world over and its summer ad blitz will make it tougher for Reebok to close the gap.<br/>\u00a0<br/>FRANK VUONO, Pres., Integrated Sports, Intl.: It may take more than what Reebok's willing to put in after they've spent the millions of dollars they've spent for their official association and after they've spent all of their marketing dollars in this particular effort, with Nike hammering away at them.<br/>\u00a0<br/>RHONDA SCHAEFFLER: Reebok says its official Olympic role is worth the price because it boosts its image around the world.  But around Atlanta, one of the most prominent images is that of the Swoosh that stole the sponsorship spotlight.  Rhonda Schaeffler, CNN Financial News, New York.<br/>\u00a0<br/>LOU DOBBS: And that is Moneyline for this Friday evening.  Thanks for being with us.  Please join us Monday night when my guest will be John Hennesey, the chairman, chief executive officer of CS/First Boston.  Until then, have a great weekend.  I'm Lou Dobbs.

It kept swinging up and down after that, the latest examples of the lightning-quick shifts in momentum that have rocked Wall Street recently. Through the tumultuous week, the S&amp;P 500 lost 2.5% to clinch its first back-to-back weekly loss in four months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Nasdaq composite, which includes many of the superstar tech stocks that have been the focus of the market's recent selling, lost 66.05, or 0.6%, to 10,853.55 after also flip-flopping between gains and losses. Its 4.1% drop for the week was its worst since market panic was peaking about the coronavirus and stocks hit a bottom in late March.</p><p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 131.06, or 0.5%, to 27,665.64, but not before careening between a gain of 294 points and a loss of 86 points.</p><p>Analysts expect swings to continue to rattle markets for weeks, if not months, as investors wait for more clarity on several key issues. At the head of the list of uncertainties is what to do with Big Tech stocks, which critics have long said were due for a slide after soaring too high through the summer.</p><p>\"The technology sell-off continues,\" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes. \"We don't think this is anything more than a technical pullback that's cleansing. It's healthy and was anticipated.\"</p><p>Apple, Amazon and others soared through the pandemic as their businesses boomed despite the recession. The coronavirus accelerated a shift to online life that's benefited them, and a pile-on of investors into Big Tech sent their share prices soaring to levels that critics said were overvalued.</p><p>Apple had a nearly irrepressible run this summer where it rose in 12 out of 13 weeks. Zoom Video Communications surged above $450 per share earlier this month after starting the year at less than $70.</p><p>That all came to an abrupt halt last week. Worries that the stocks had gotten overheated helped send the S&amp;P 500 to its worst three-day run in nearly three months, and the Nasdaq composite slid 10%. Tech stocks recovered a bit on Wednesday, and they seemed to regain their stride Thursday morning, only for an afternoon swoon to batter them again.</p><p>On Friday, tech stocks again swung from gains to losses. The fluctuations came even after Oracle reported stronger profit for its latest quarter than analysts expected. After leaping as much as 7.9% in the morning, its stock slipped 0.6%.</p><p>Big Tech and the high-growth area of the stock market \"just got ahead of itself,\" said Jason Pride, chief investment officer of private wealth at Glenmede. \"It doesn't matter how it got there, it matters that it got there and now we're kind of deflating that overvaluation a little bit.\"</p><p>After rising as much as 1.5% shortly after trading began, Apple fell back to a loss of 1.3%. It dropped 7.4% over the week, its worst since March. Movements for it and other Big Tech stocks matter more than ever for broad market indexes because their immense size means they can influence the S&amp;P 500 almost by themselves. Five Big Tech companies make up nearly 23% of the index's entire value.</p><p>One big factor that remains in the stock market's favor is the Federal Reserve, which continues to pump aid into the economy. It has slashed short-term interest rates to record lows and bought up all kinds of bonds to support markets. It also said recently it will keep delivering stimulus even if inflation rises above its target level, as long as inflation had been well under it before then.</p><p>A report on Friday showed that inflation remains low, though it was higher than economists expected. Consumer prices rose 1.3% in August from a year earlier, a shade above the 1.2% that investors were expecting.</p><p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.66% from 0.68% late Thursday.</p><p>Unprecedented amounts of aid from Congress, along with the Federal Reserve, also helped the stock market halt its nearly 34% plummet in late March.</p><p>But it looks less likely by the day that Congress will approve more support for the limping economy before the November elections, even though investors say such stimulus is crucial after unemployment benefits and other stimulus has expired. Senate Democrats on Thursday shot down a scaled-back package proposed by Republicans, saying it shortchanged too many needs.</p><p>Investors are also worried about all the uncertainty that elections bring generally, which can result in big changes for tax laws and regulations that affect corporate profits. Concerns are likewise high about trade tensions between the United States and China, among other major economies, and whether the expectations building for a coming COVID-19 vaccine prove to be too optimistic.</p><p>European stock markets made modest moves. The German DAX was close to flat, and the French CAC 40 rose 0.2%. The FTSE 100 in London rose 0.5%</p><p>Asian markets were stronger. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.7%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong climbed 0.8% and stocks in Shanghai added 0.8%. The Kospi in South Korea was close to flat.</p><p>---</p><p>AP Business Writer Yuri Kageyama contributed.</p><p>Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The benchmark index was up 0.1%, as of 9:55 a.m. Eastern time, following a mixed performance for stocks overseas. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 38 points, or 0.1%, at 26,772, and the Nasdaq composite was virtually flat. </p><p>Trading was relatively quiet across markets, with Treasury yields, gold and crude oil all making only modest moves. Even Chinese stocks were holding relatively steady: The Shanghai Composite index inched up just 0.1% following a run earlier this month where its average daily move was more than 2%.  Most stocks across the U.S. market were higher, with homebuilders and construction-material companies helping to lead the way after a report showed a bigger jump in home construction during June than economists expected. PulteGroup rose 2%, and Lennar added 1.7%. Netflix fell 6.9% for the largest loss in the S&amp;#38;P 500 after its forecast for new subscribers during the summer fell short of Wall Street's own expectations, even though it reported stronger earnings for the spring than analysts expected.  It's a relatively rare step down for Netflix, which is still up roughly 50% for 2020 so far.  This week has seen some weakness for big tech-oriented stocks, which have been gliding higher through much of the pandemic on expectations that they can continue to grow almost regardless of the economy. The big run has critics saying they've become too expensive, even after accounting for the huge profits that they produce.  Microsoft slipped another 0.8% Friday, while Apple dipped 0.1%. Tech stocks across the S&amp;#38;P 500 were down 0.1% in early trading, while internet and other communication-services stocks were down 0.7%. They were two of only three sectors in the S&amp;#38;P 500 that were lower. (Ad) In a form NS 43-101, two energy sector legends have told federal regulators that they may have found one of the world's biggest lithium discoveries - a massive 7 million tons near Tonopah, Nevada, worth around $70 billion. The S&amp;#38;P 500 is on track for a 1.1% rise for the week, though that would be the mildest in its three-week run. It's rallied back within 5% of its record set in February and is back to roughly where it was in early June. Pushing stocks up recently have been signs of improvement in the economy, along with rising hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine. Underlying it all is massive aid for the economy and the promise of ultralow interest rates from the Federal Reserve.  But pulling stocks down at the same time have been worries about the continuing rise in coronavirus counts across the country, which threatens to derail the improvements.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 0.61%.  In the commodities markets, gold added 0.5% to $1,809.40 per ounce. Benchmark U.S. crude oil inched up 5 cents to $40.98. Brent crude, the international standard, slipped 12 cents to $43.25 per barrel. In Europe, Germany's DAX returned 0.4%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.2%. The FTSE 100 in London added 0.6%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3%, South Korea's Kospi added 0.8% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.5%.6 Stocks to Help You Profit Off the Coronavirus PPE Boom[1]Every major global event brings with it changes to our national lexicon. Before the Covid-19 pandemic, few Americans knew what the initials PPE stood for. Today, virtually anyone knows that PPE stands for personal protective equipment. At the onset of the mitigation policies, the goal of flattening the curve was being done to prevent our health care system from becoming overwhelmed. Part of that concern stemmed from a shortage of personal protective equipment. These are the masks, gloves, goggles and gowns that help protect medical workers against viral or bacterial infections. As the novel coronavirus became labeled a global pandemic, the global mantra became to 'flatten the curve' in an effort to prevent our healthcare system from being overwhelmed. The United States is being referred to as being on a war time footing. Manufacturers that were already producing PPE have significantly ramped up capacity. And many companies are converting their excess manufacturing capacity to produce personal protective equipment. In fairness, this may only be a reason for some of these companies to 'keep the lights on' right now. But many of these companies have a good story to tell. And it's that story that can make them solid investments in the future. View the \"6 Stocks to Help You Profit Off the Coronavirus PPE Boom\"[2].

Asian stock markets rebounded Friday after Wall Street closed lower amid uncertainty about the U.S. economic outlook. (AP Photo/Lee Jin-man)NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Wall Street is drifting Friday following another set of mixed reports on the economy, as the S&amp;#38;P 500 closes in on its third straight weekly gain.  The benchmark index was virtually unchanged in midday trading, after earlier flipping between small gains and losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 53 points, or 0.2%, at 26,680, as of 10:54 a.m. Eastern time, and the Nasdaq composite was down 0.1%.  Trading was relatively quiet across markets, with stocks overseas, Treasury yields and gold also making only modest moves. </p><p>Even Chinese stocks were holding relatively steady: The Shanghai Composite index inched up 0.1% following a run earlier this month where its average daily move was more than 2%.  The U.S. market lost some of its early momentum after a report showed that consumer sentiment was weaker than economists expected. It's the latest in a stream of reports that have shown how uncertain the path is for the economy, as a continuing rise in coronavirus counts threatens to undo improvements that seemed to have taken root in the economy. 'The market just continues to try and get its finger on the pulse,' said James McCann, senior global economist at Aberdeen Standard Investments. 'The renewed spread of the virus and degree of community infection means the pace of recovery we've had is just not going to be able to hold up anymore,' he said. 'A fairly decent chunk of U.S. activity is at risk.'  Amid all the uncertainty, the S&amp;#38;P 500 was nearly evenly split between stocks rising and falling.  BlackRock rose 2.8% for one of the biggest gains in the S&amp;#38;P 500 after the investment firm reported a stronger profit for the spring than analysts expected.  Home builders were also pulling higher after a report showed a bigger jump in home construction during June than economists expected. PulteGroup rose 1%, and Lennar added 1.4%. (Ad) In a form NS 43-101, two energy sector legends have told federal regulators that they may have found one of the world's biggest lithium discoveries - a massive 7 million tons near Tonopah, Nevada, worth around $70 billion. On the losing end was Netflix, which fell 7.1% for the largest loss in the S&amp;#38;P 500. Its forecast for new subscribers during the summer fell short of Wall Street's own expectations, even though it reported stronger earnings for the spring than analysts expected. It's a relatively rare step down for Netflix, which is still up roughly 50% for 2020 so far.  This week has seen some weakness for big tech-oriented stocks generally, after they had glided through most of the pandemic. Investors have continued to add to bets that Apple, Microsoft and other giants can keep growing almost regardless of the economy. The big run has critics saying they've become too expensive, even after accounting for the huge profits that they produce. Microsoft slipped another 1% Friday, while Apple dipped 0.5%, and tech companies across the S&amp;#38;P 500 were down 0.3%. The declines helped bring the loss for the week for S&amp;#38;P 500 tech stocks to 1.9%, the largest among the 11 sectors that make up the index.  Regions Financial fell 3.5% Friday after reporting a loss for the latest quarter, when analysts were expecting a profit.  The S&amp;#38;P 500 is on track for a 0.9% rise for the week, though that would be the mildest in a three-week winning stretch. It's rallied back within roughly 5% of its record set in February and is back to roughly where it was in early June. Pushing stocks up recently have been improvements in hiring, retail sales and other parts of the economy, along with rising hopes for a COVID-19 vaccine. Underlying it all is massive aid for the economy and the promise of ultralow interest rates from the Federal Reserve.  But pulling stocks down at the same time has been the relentless rise of coronavirus counts across much of the country. California has already ordered bars and other businesses to close down again amid a spike in infections, and the worry is that wider shutdowns of the economy may be inevitable.  The yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 0.61%. It tends to move with investors' expectations for the economy and inflation. In the commodities markets, gold added 0.6% to $1,810.80 per ounce. Benchmark U.S. crude oil slipped 28 cents to $40.65. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 41 cents to $42.96 per barrel. In Europe, Germany's DAX returned 0.3%, and France's CAC 40 slipped 0.5%. The FTSE 100 in London added 0.5%. In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 slipped 0.3%, South Korea's Kospi added 0.8% and the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rose 0.5%.Analysts Hate These 12 Stocks[1]When a single Wall Street analyst downgrades one of your stocks, you might think they are just having a bad day or have an incorrect investment thesis.

Following a morning rally, major US indexes pulled back steeply after a Bloomberg report that the United States is preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports by early December if talks next month between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping falter.  \"Obviously this trade skirmish is metastasising potentially into something worse than it already is,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.  After the S&amp;amp;P 500 dropped more than 10 per cent from its September 20 record closing high during the session, the benchmark index pared its losses late to close down 9.9 per cent from its peak. </p><p>The Dow industrials also fell more than 10 per cent from its October 3 record close during the session, before ending down 8.9 per cent from the mark.  On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 245.39 points, or 0.99 per cent, to 24,442.92, the S&amp;amp;P 500 lost 17.44 points, or 0.66 per cent, to 2,641.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 116.92 points, or 1.63 per cent, to 7,050.29.  Major tech and growth stocks, such as Amazon.com  Inc , Google parent Alphabet Incand Netflix Inc , posted sharp declines. The S&amp;amp;P 500 technology sector fell 1.8 per cent.  The industrials sector, which is seen as sensitive to trade issues, dropped 1.7 per cent, with Boeing Co tumbling 6.6 per cent.  \"The concern about global growth and global trade ... continues to create an overhang for US corporations and global equities,\" said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisers in Florham Park, New Jersey.  \"Growth stocks typically do poorly in situations of global growth decelerating,\" he said. \"You set yourself up for a more defensive market until there's a clear sign that investors can grab hold of.\"  Market volatility has spiked in recent weeks, stemming from higher interest rates and worries about the economy and trade tensions. Investors also may be increasingly nervous about uncertainty surrounding US congressional elections, now just a week away.  \"Probably the most pervasive headwind is concern about midterm elections,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. \"That is weighing down stocks, particularly technology as there is greater concern about regulation.\"  Internet stocks also may have been wounded by Britain's plan to tax the revenue from online platforms.  In corporate news, shares of software maker Red Hat Inc surged 45.4 per cent after the company agreed to be bought by IBM Corpfor $34 billion. But IBM shares fell 4.1 per cent, weighing on the Dow and S&amp;amp;P.  Investors who are bullish about stocks point to strong corporate profits this year and economic strength. But there are also concerns about the extent of a slowdown in earnings growth next year, while weak housing data has raised some worries about the economy.  Data on Monday showed US consumer spending rose for a seventh consecutive month in September. But income recorded its smallest gain in more than a year amid moderate wage growth, suggesting the current pace of spending was unlikely to be sustained.  Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favoured decliners. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN947838020181030</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TM6-YGR1-J9XT-P3JV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"593\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 30, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Following a morning rally, major U.S. indexes pulled back steeply after a Bloomberg report that the United States is preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports by early December if talks next month between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping falter. \"Obviously this trade skirmish is metastasizing potentially into something worse than it already is,\" said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia. </p><p>After the S...00 dropped more than 10 percent from its Sept. 20 record closing high during the session, the benchmark index pared its losses late to close down 9.9 percent from its peak. The Dow industrials also fell more than 10 percent from its Oct. 3 record close during the session, before ending down 8.9 percent from the mark. On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 245.39 points, or 0.99 percent, to 24,442.92, the S...00 lost 17.44 points, or 0.66 percent, to 2,641.25 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 116.92 points, or 1.63 percent, to 7,050.29. Major tech and growth stocks, such as Amazon.com, Google parent Alphabet and Netflix, posted sharp declines. The S...00 technology sector fell 1.8 percent. The so-called FANG growth stocks - Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet - have lost more than $200 billion in market value in the past two sessions. The industrials sector, which is seen as sensitive to trade issues, dropped 1.7 percent, with Boeing tumbling 6.6 percent. \"The concern about global growth and global trade ... continues to create an overhang for U.S. corporations and global equities,\" said Chad Morganlander, senior portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors in Florham Park, New Jersey. \"Growth stocks typically do poorly in situations of global growth decelerating,\" he said. \"You set yourself up for a more defensive market until there's a clear sign that investors can grab hold of.\" Market volatility has spiked in recent weeks, stemming from higher interest rates and worries about the economy and trade tensions. Investors also may be increasingly nervous about uncertainty surrounding U.S. congressional elections, now just a week away. \"Probably the most pervasive headwind is concern about midterm elections,\" said Kristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco. \"That is weighing down stocks, particularly technology as there is greater concern about regulation.\" Internet stocks also may have been wounded by Britain's plan to tax the revenue from online platforms. In corporate news, shares of software maker Red Hat surged 45.4 percent after the company agreed to be bought by IBM Corp for $34 billion. But IBM shares fell 4.1 percent, weighing on the Dow and S#38;P. Investors who are bullish about stocks point to strong corporate profits this year and economic strength. But there are also concerns about the extent of a slowdown in earnings growth next year, while weak housing data has raised some worries about the economy. Data on Monday showed U.S. consumer spending rose for a seventh consecutive month in September. But income recorded its smallest gain in more than a year amid moderate wage growth, suggesting the current pace of spending was unlikely to be sustained. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.45-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.45-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S...00 posted three new 52-week highs and 65 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 23 new highs and 260 new lows. About 9.3 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, above the 8.5 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FEDBLG-USGFDAGFDAG10AS130912154086163825225176500166</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FDAG10AS-130912</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TM2-JPP1-DXN1-C04K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">405244</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"651\"/><timeReceived>1:07 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Federal NewsFeed <br/>Voice of America</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 30, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001YM8</classCode><className>INVESCO LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Chevron's 1.4-per cent fall and Exxon's 0.6-per cent drop were among the biggest drags on the S&amp;P.<br/> Oil prices were pressured by growing gasoline stockpiles in the United States as evidence of a burgeoning revival in US shale production could complicate efforts to reduce a supply glut.<br/> \"If we are going into a quarter or two of lower energy prices ... the story of improving earnings for the S&amp;P 500, with the help of improving earnings in energy companies, may be suspect,\" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice-president at BB&amp;T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama.<br/> Tech stocks helped prop up the S&amp;P. Apple rose about 1 per cent and Google parent Alphabet gained 0.9 per cent. Consumer staples were the best performing S&amp;P group, rising 0.8 per cent.<br/> In corporate earnings news, Emerson Electric shares rose 4.5 per cent after the manufacturer reported a higher-than-expected profit.<br/> General Motors fell 4.7 per cent after the automaker said that fourth-quarter net income fell partly on the strength of the dollar against the British pound and forecast flat 2017 profit per share.<br/> Michael Kors dropped 10.8 per cent, after the handbag maker forecast current-quarter profit below estimates.<br/> After the market closed, Walt Disney shares fell following the company's quarterly report.<br/> About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in US exchanges, slightly below the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions.<br/> Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favoured decliners.<br/> The S&amp;P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 108 new highs and 40 new lows.<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSLIN-n9788867</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSLIN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MTX-RV71-JBYT-H48T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402751</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-12-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"540\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 FFC Information Solution All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Line</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20189\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"02\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>February 8, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002EUA</classCode><className>THOMSON REUTERS CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0001QY8</classCode><className>EMERSON ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>TRI (TSX)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>TRI (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>EMR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>GM (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Stock Exchanges</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0ZDMDg5MEQ3OTlGNEJCMkI0M0EyM0MwN0E1Njk1MEQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDBGREFBMDgyNTQ0NERFRUI3MEUwNDBFOTM5NDExREI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001631</classCode><className>STOCK INDEXES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001242</classCode><className>OIL &amp;

Energy was the worst-performing S&amp;P sector, falling 1.4 percent. Chevron's 1.4-percent fall and Exxon's 0.6-percent drop were among the biggest drags on the S&amp;P. Oil prices were pressured by growing gasoline stockpiles in the United States as evidence of a burgeoning revival in U.S. shale production could complicate efforts to reduce a supply glut.   If we are going into a quarter or two of lower energy prices ... the story of improving earnings for the S&amp;P 500, with the help of improving earnings in energy companies, may be suspect,\" said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&amp;T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. Tech stocks helped prop up the S&amp;P. Apple rose about 1 percent and Google parent Alphabet gained 0.9 percent. Consumer staples were the best performing S&amp;P group, rising 0.8 percent. In corporate earnings news, Emerson Electric shares rose 4.5 percent after the manufacturer reported a higher-than-expected profit. General Motors fell 4.7 percent after the automaker said that fourth-quarter net income fell partly on the strength of the dollar against the British pound and forecast flat 2017 profit per share. Michael Kors dropped 10.8 percent, after the handbag maker forecast current-quarter profit below estimates. After the market closed, Walt Disney shares fell following the company's quarterly report. About 6.6 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, slightly below the 6.7 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&amp;P 500 posted 32 new 52-week highs and 4 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 108 new highs and 40 new lows.
