Hoping to better serve its biggest investors, the Houston company wanted a place where its shares would be closely shepherded, an exchange that eagerly wanted an enterprising technology company in its midst. So last month, BMC made the move: It left the Nasdaq and took its ticker symbol to the old man of the markets, the New York Stock Exchange. \"We could not be more pleased with our move,\" says John Cox, BMC's acting CFO. \"It reinforces that BMC is truly a global company. The NYSE is clearly recognized as a global player.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Big Board is back. Since the Internet stock bubble burst last year, the NYSE has gone from a hoary home for old-economy stocks to a steady port in a raging storm for stocks like BMC. Just as the NYSE has started relaxing its staid nature, officials are finding that slow-and-steady is back in favor, thanks to the crash of a market that many say rose too fast. \"You go out with flashier guys,\" says Catherine Kinney, a group executive VP at the exchange. \"But you marry stable men.\"</p><p>Since tech stocks started to collapse last March, more than 800 companies have delisted from the Nasdaq, many because they failed to meet minimum financial requirements. Meanwhile, the NYSE is busier than ever: The number of shares traded on the exchange is up 19 percent from a year ago, and down 6 percent on the Nasdaq. And one of the Nasdaq's finest feats -- a merger agreement between its parent and the American Stock Exchange -- seemed close to unraveling last week.</p><p>It's quite a rebound for the 200-year-old New York Stock Exchange, which a few years ago seemed hopelessly out of step. With the explosion of technology companies in the late '90s, the Nasdaq was the place to be. Between 1996 and 2000, more than 3,300 companies listed on the Nasdaq in the same period, the NYSE added far fewer. In a gloating ad campaign, the Nasdaq proudly proclaimed itself the stock exchange of the 21st century.</p><p>The NYSE also faced competition from electronic communications networks, or ECNs, such as Instinet and Island. So far, the alternative exchanges haven't posed a serious threat, giving NYSE Chairman Richard Grasso time to prepare his own electronic platform.</p><p>Struggling to keep pace, the NYSE has upgraded its technology and changed its once-rigid standards to attract technology companies. It recently launched a TV ad campaign and is moving nimbly to match the Nasdaq in expanding global stock trading.</p><p>The structure of the NYSE is incentive enough for some companies to switch. BMC, for instance, considers the Nasdaq's all-electronic trading system a turnoff. The NYSE employs specialists on its stocks, individuals on the exchange floor who maintain a level of liquidity and smooth trading that Nasdaq critics say has been missing from its untouched-by-human-hands trading system. That's what drew BMC to the old exchange. \"If you're a big institutional shareholder making multiple trades, you'll save money on the NYSE,\" says BMC's Cox. \"The pricing you get, trade to trade, will be better.\"</p><p>Joining BMC at the Big Board this year alone are E-Trade, IDT Corp. and Qwest Communications. Next month, Krispy Kreme Doughnut, one of last year's few IPO successes, will move from the Nasdaq to the NYSE. E-Trade was an especially sweet victory. \"The brand is enormously well-known,\" says Kinney. \"And while they're in the financial services space, the company is perceived as a tech company out in the Valley.\"</p><p>Taken together with the listings of recent telecom spinoffs Agere and AT&amp;T Wireless on the NYSE, the exchange's efforts to turn around its image seem to be slowly gaining ground.</p><p>For its part, Nasdaq seems a little peeved by the attention its rival is getting. The 30-year-old Nasdaq says recent defectors are simply taking a stab at improving their image by moving to an older exchange. \"In a down market, with a sell-off, a lot of people are looking for a reason to change,\" says David Weild, a Nasdaq executive VP who heads its corporate client division. \"It's like the owner of a baseball franchise. When the team's not performing well, they fire the manager.\"</p><p>Weild seems to hold E-Trade in particular contempt. \"They want to bask in comparison to the MerrillLynches of the world,\" he says \"I don't think it has anything at all to do with the Nasdaq or the NYSE. It has to do with trying to signal to the marketplace that you're a more traditional kind of company in a market that they think is going to value traditional companies more highly.\"</p><p>Snatching four tech listings and a doughnut stock may be more symbolic than substantive tech giants ranging from Cisco to Intel to Microsoft seem content to stay on the Nasdaq, which has served them since their infancies. And the NYSE may have been its own worst enemy in failing to list the tech leaders -- its listing fees and requirements were often too onerous for growing companies. It may have won huge IPOs like Lucent, but it missed out on hundreds of smaller companies -- many of which, like Dell and Intel, are now valued in the tens of billions of dollars. It didn't have an IPO program in place until the mid-1980s. Even now, only a quarter of the IPOS that come to market meet the Big Board's requirements.</p><p>Grasso has had to think twice about the NYSE's standards. In 1999, the exchange introduced a revenue standard: Companies with a $1 billion market cap and $100 million in revenue are now eligible to list. The traditional cash-flow and earnings standards remain in place. And while the revenue standard marks a sharp departure from tradition, NYSE officials say the ceiling is high enough to keep out unstable companies. The exchange has also cut its listing fees in half. Previously capped at $500 million, they were slashed to $250 million this year.</p><p>As for the NYSE's stodgy image, Kinney says the exchange has failed to show that it houses the biggest trends in business. \"We haven't done an effective job of telling our story,\" she says. The story is large: Of the NYSE's $16 trillion in total market value, nearly one-third, $5.5 trillion, is invested in tech, media and telecom companies -- an amount twice as large as the entire Nasdaq market. Another one-third of the NYSE's total market cap comes from companies with headquarters outside the United States. If either of those segments were to be spun off, they would form the second-largest stock exchange in the world, after the NYSE itself.</p><p>Of course, the Nasdaq has a good number of foreign companies, including Ericsson and Research in Motion. But many of the leading tech companies, such as Nokia and Nortel, are on the Big Board. Other international listings include European blue chips such as German electronics giant Siemens and French media and communications company Vivendi. The developing markets have sent China Unicom, Petroblas from Brazil and Wipro from India. And while the Nasdaq has a slightly larger number of international companies listed, the NYSE has landed the heavyweights: The Nasdaq market cap in this segment is $120 billion, compared with $5.5 trillion on the NYSE.</p><p>The NYSE's edge in attracting global trading giants has also helped its efforts to form a global trading platform. This is an area where the exchange is working to thwart the Nasdaq's continuing expansion. Nasdaq recently purchased a majority ownership in Easdaq, a pan-European stock exchange. Taken together with Nasdaq Japan -- a Tokyo-based joint venture with Softbank -- the exchange is positioning itself to become a major player in an age when investors can more easily trade stocks in overseas markets.</p><p>The Big Board has similar plans, aiming to offer an auction model that respects the structure and regulations of local exchanges, while still offering liquidity globally. It's an ambitiouseffort, but officials say plans are under way to implement the new platform next year.</p><p>In the meantime, the NYSE is angling to bring more technology companies into the fold. On its wish list are about 650 companies, including a few Nasdaq crown jewels like Microsoft and Cisco. \"If I could get[Cisco CEO]John Chambers to list before I retire,\" says Kinney, \"I'd have a hell of a party.\"</p><p>Switch Hitters</p><p>Since November, five leading technology companies have moved their stocks from the Nasdaq to the New York Stock Exchange, while none has moved the other way.</p><p><table><title>COMPANY \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0DATE OF MOVE \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0MARKET CAP *</title><tgroup cols=\"3\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec align=\"left\" colname=\"col1\" colwidth=\"264\"/><colspec align=\"right\" colname=\"col2\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec align=\"right\" colname=\"col3\" colwidth=\"32\"/><tbody><row><entry>BMC Software</entry><entry>March 2001</entry><entry>$6.7</entry></row><row><entry>E-Trade</entry><entry>February 2001</entry><entry>$2.6</entry></row><row><entry>IDT Corp.</entry><entry>February 2001</entry><entry>$0.6</entry></row><row><entry>Qwest Communications January 2001</entry><entry>$59.5</entry></row><row><entry>Global Crossing</entry><entry>November 2000</entry><entry>$9.0</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col1\">(*.)IN BILLIONS.</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col1\">AS OF APRIL 17.</entry></row><row><entry nameend=\"col3\" namest=\"col1\">SOURCE: NYSE</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Copyright 2001 Standard Media InternationalCopyright 2001 Standard Media International1457</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RDSB&amp;I-2877724</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">2877724 B&amp;I</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4F9T-VH10-010B-M42D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">210548</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1473\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2001 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>\u00a0Industry Standard</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 1098-9196</issn><volume>Vol. 4</volume><issueNumber>No. 17</issueNumber><aggregationName>Business and Industry</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>April 30, 2001</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Journal</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Fulltext</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009SWF</classCode><className>NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0006KB5</classCode><className>NYSE MKT LLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS523210 SECURITIES &amp;

In June 2015, Snapchat averaged 89 million daily active users overall, per Snap's S-1 filing. Headlines at that time said otherwise.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Spiegel, in the midst of getting grilled by reporters Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher, was answering the same question posed to every tech company: How are your numbers?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Silicon Valley was built on metrics: users, time spent, pictures uploaded, etc. These numbers made even young startups look like they could conquer the world and make billions of dollars along the way.</p><p> And they can be gamed. Young and hungry techies have often been counseled to do whatever they must to achieve success. Fake it 'til you make it.</p><p> Spiegel isn't the first person to inflate his company's numbers, and he won't be the last. Find a big tech company \u2014 Facebook, Twitter, Uber, Airbnb \u2014 and you'll inevitably find some story of how they had an \"oops, that number isn't quite right\" moment somewhere along the way.</p><p> The ruse is starting to wear thin.</p><p> The numbers game</p><p> Snapchat in particular has been under fire for its metrics from a former employee who is claiming the company did more than miscalculate or gently massage its numbers.</p><p> Anthony Pompliano is claiming outright fraud.</p><p> \"I have proof,\" Pompliano told Mashable, speaking for the first time since filing a lawsuit against Snap. \"And they continue to attempt to silence me by pushing this case into arbitration, out of the public eye, but I'm not going anywhere, and they may have made disappearing photos famous, but they cannot make facts disappear.\"</p><p> Tech companies thrive or die by metrics. Investors could look at a balance sheet and evaluate the profit and revenue of a company, but that doesn't work as well for Silicon Valley startups that launch without a direct profit model. Instead, they present a variety of user numbers, many of which can be gamed with the magic of \"growth hacking.\"</p><p> Growth hacking is a ubiquitous dark art in tech. Companies routinely employ a variety of tricks and strategies to boost their numbers. Some are reasonable but annoying. Others can toe a serious ethical line. For example, Twitter has been known to email inactive users, pushing them to sign in.</p><p> Tech companies are emboldened by the fact that there are no real requirements on what companies share or which metrics to use. Facebook has the most users, but when people try to compare other platforms to the social media giant, it's not easy. Twitter only shares monthly active users, not daily ones. Snapchat only shares daily, not monthly.</p><p> With many tech companies staying private for longer, they also get to selectively release their numbers. Even when companies start raising money and maybe go public, they still don't reveal everything \u2014 to many people, that secrecy and inaccuracies come at a cost. Tech is littered with examples, but here's a few from the major players:</p><p> *</p><p> Sept. 2016: Facebook overestimated video views , misleading advertisers who purchase video time based on that metric for two years</p><p> *</p><p> Jan. 2017: Uber paid a $20 million fine  after its software exaggerated how much its drivers could earn and downplayed the cost of car financing.</p><p> *</p><p> Aug. 2017: Google issued refunds  for ads with fake web traffic.</p><p> *</p><p> Oct. 2017: Twitter admitted it overcounted  its user numbers over three years.</p><p> Calculated risk</p><p> Companies do have some reasons for what numbers they share.</p><p> \"People choose the number that they think best represents their business, and that doesn't always make it easy to draw comparisons,\" said Jeremy Liew, a venture capitalist at Lightspeed Venture Partners who was the first invest in Snapchat.</p><p> Liew noted how Snapchat, as a messaging app, invigorated the trend of sharing daily active users. Another one of the company's investments, daily trivia app HQ, has spurred a recognition to minute active users. Of course, it's not all organic. For HQ, money is a big motivation for smartphone owners' attention, and HQ uses push notifications to make sure people sign on for the game.</p><p> Not everything a company does in regards to numbers necessarily means its \"bad actor\" behavior. Tech companies hire data experts to evaluate metrics and enact strategies on how to grow them.</p><p> \"Early days you really want to look at retention and stickiness. It's very easy to fall in this trap. They call it a ring of fire. You can have one user on day 1, 4, 8, 16, but you might be leaving behind user one,\" said Jason Schissel, a data scientist at Facebook who has also worked at Snap and LinkedIn.</p><p> The tricks of the trade are controversial even in Silicon Valley. Spiegel at one point publicly derided growth hacking. On his first quarterly earnings call with investors, he responded to an analyst's question on growth hacking and his app's push notifications with, \"Yeah, so I think there are plenty of examples online [laughs] if you want to go for a Google.\"</p><p> And yet:</p><p> This looks a lot like that growth hacking you hate so much, Snapchat... pic.twitter.com/JXBledzVlF</p><p> \u2014 Erin Griffith (@eringriffith) June 28, 2017</p><p> For the case of Spiegel touting 100 million daily active users, that wasn't an app-related trick but instead a clear overstatement by a CEO with the platform of a stage.</p><p> \"When I got there, there were multiple data sources with numbers that did not match,\" Pompliano told Mashable.</p><p> Two former employees at Snapchat confirmed to Mashable that the 100-million milestone was expressed in meetings by executives before it was really reached.</p><p> Snapchat denies, however, that it engaged in fraud. Shortly after the filing, Snap's attorneys called Pompliano a \"disgruntled employee\" who was \"fired for poor performance.\"</p><p> Pompliano says he has evidence; he also has another man in his court. Carson Block, a short-seller and founder of investment firm Muddy Waters, became interested in Snap and investigated Pompliano and his claims after his suit was filed. Block first gained notoriety for alleging fraudulent accounting in publicly traded Chinese companies.</p><p> As a publicly traded company, Snap has to release its financials. Those  \u2014 like $443 million in net losses over the third quarter of 2017 \u2014 can be deciphered. Metrics? Those are tougher.</p><p> \"These metrics, there's no basis where you can reconcile. I think it puts us in a dangerous area,\" Block said.</p><p> There are no rules requiring companies to share further breakdowns of daily active users. But those numbers could be leaked, as The Daily Beast proved last week.</p><p> Grading your own homework</p><p> Regardless of what happens in his case, Pompliano is not alone in his call for companies like Snap to be questioned, audited, and potentially regulated.</p><p> \"It's like having the ability to grade your own homework,\" said Bob Liodice, Association of National Advertisers CEO. He was speaking about how, in September 2016, Facebook had been caught miscounting video views.</p><p> Months later, Facebook agreed to be audited by the Media Rating Council (MRC), the media industry's measurement watchdog. More than a year in, the auditing process is ongoing.</p><p>Facebook has revealed numerous other metrics problems since.</p><p> \"This isn't like we put a stamp of approval, and they pay us, and we walk away. This involves thousands of hours of testing,\" said George Ivie, CEO and executive director of MRC. \"They have to open [the systems] up completely to us. We can't audit it without precise detail.\"</p><p>Facebook, Google, and Twitter have each agreed to an audit. Snap has had conversations.</p><p>Facebook, Google, and Twitter have each agreed to an audit by the MRC, meaning they've opened up their advertising systems to be tested for authenticity. It's something some advertisers had been asking for years but had not been agreed upon until the situation became downright embarrassing. Snap has had conversations with the MRC but has not committed to one, Ivie told Mashable.</p><p> These tech platforms aren't the only ones dealing with ad fraud. There's a number of fake internet traffic schemes pushed by publishers, ad agencies, and ad tech networks.</p><p> For private and public investors, there are rules against fraud. There's also a stark difference between a bad actor who comes forward with problems and one that continues to hide them.</p><p> What comes next</p><p> Do all these errors really matter? For Facebook, investors still admire its 2 billion-plus monthly active users and growing user base. Meanwhile, investors fixate on Twitter's slowing user growth year over year, so even its error of potentially 2 million didn't reflect much.</p><p> Any errors do call into question what else could be wrong.</p><p> Errors \"show sloppiness in the management team. Why weren't you precise about it? If you were loosey-goosey about that, what else were you loosey-goosey about?\" said Venky Ganesan, managing director at Menlo Ventures.</p><p> Silicon Valley hasn't been forced to clean up its act just yet, but change could be coming.</p><p> Back in the early 1960s, the U.S. Congress asked the media industry to self-regulate around measurement due to a \"quiz show scandal,\" where advertisers alleged a show's ratings were rigged. The MRC was born and is now a team of seven people. Still, the audit of its advertising metrics doesn't include everything, and platforms like Snap haven't agreed to an audit \u2014 yet.</p><p> More recently, tech companies have caught the attention of the U.S. government. The general counsels of Facebook, Google, and Twitter have all testified last year in front of lawmakers in the wake of Russian propaganda spreading on their platforms during the 2016 presidential election.</p><p> \"You've created these platforms, and now they're being misused,\" said Sen. Dianne Feinstein during the hearing with Senate Intelligence Committee. \"You have to be the ones to do something about it, or we will.\"</p><p> Sen. Feinstein and the other lawmakers focused the warnings on political ads and propaganda but also spotlighted the strength of these systems beyond those areas. As Sen. John Kennedy said, \"Your power scares me.\"</p><p> Indeed, tech giants have influenced how we individually behave and where our money goes. Facebook and Google accounted for about 63 percent of digital ad revenue in the U.S. this year, according to eMarketer.</p><p> These companies have clearly profited, but at what cost? Not every number is externally fact-checked, although the MRC audit will lead to some scale of confidence when it comes to advertising.</p><p> Still, not every number publicly shared is done so with the best intentions. But the companies keep growing, and the founders keep sharing.</p><p> And the numbers usually keep going up.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Image: Vicky Leta/Mashable</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MSHNWS-4d199bde9ef75ea93ca4dbaa7a6d5c5bcec4535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F289C251672A101 MSHNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RFH-8D31-DXVP-V043-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401989</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1777\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Mashable, Inc.<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

TV ratings. Say what you will about the reliability of entertainment consumption metrics, but for decades, what people watched was hardly hush-hush. Then subscription video streamers came along. Now, massive data is collected about viewing habits but is disclosed only at the discretion of the companies sucking it up. Netflix says it will become more transparent in 2020. But will it? And who knows if the numbers it releases are inaccurate or misleading? How much should the rest of Hollywood care about transparency?</p><p>Well, consider that less than two years ago, Time Warner's then-CEO Jeff Bewkes took the witness stand during a trial where the U.S. government attempted to block his company's merger with AT&amp;T. Bewkes pointed to Amazon, Netflix, YouTube and Facebook before explaining that these companies \"know more about our consumers than we do.\" The merger was justified, he explained, because digital giants possessed something that one of Hollywood's biggest media companies sorely needed--data. \"The more you know about viewers, the more it informs your programming,\" he said. \"It helps you understand how to optimize.\"</p><p>Hollywood is catching up. Disney has launched its data-sucking streaming service Disney+ while others including AT&amp;T's HBO Max will be running soon enough. With a 21st century operation, though, comes a 21st century problem: the potential for regulation. Government intervention could drop a bomb on the so-called streaming wars.</p><p>Only in the past few years have academics begun discussing whether Big Data presents antitrust issues, and if so, what to do about it. Spurred by frustration at the might of companies like Google and Facebook, lawmakers and regulators on both sides of the political aisle have in recent months openly endorsed the scrutinizing of companies that are leveraging their inside knowledge about consumer habits to the disadvantage of third parties.</p><p>On Nov. 8, Department of Justice antitrust chief Makan Delrahim sounded his own alarm in a speech at Harvard. Delrahim said that the aggregation of data can create avenues for abuse--especially for companies in the business of predicting human behavior (for advertising, yes, but perhaps also what entertainment programming you might want to see if you just watched The Irishman). He also responded to those who see such concerns as overstated because data collection has been happening for decades. (His example was grocery stores collecting information about consumer purchasing patterns through loyalty cards. Nielsen ratings would have worked just as well.) Something has changed, Delrahim warned.</p><p>\"Antitrust enforcers must examine carefully whether greater competitive harms are threatened given today's market realities,\" he said. \"For example, enforcers might consider whether the scale of the data collected has increased by several magnitudes; the type of data collected; and what it means when companies collect usage data, which cannot be easily replicated, in addition to user data. Most notably, enforcers must confront the reality that data insights in the digital economy are combined across the ecosystem of the internet sometimes in ways that transcend product improvement and impact consumer choice altogether.\"</p><p>It's happening slowly, but antitrust regulators like Delrahim are now being urged to look beyond Google and Facebook and review how data is being leveraged as a competitive weapon in the digital entertainment space. And the expressed openness by conservative legal thinkers (including Attorney General William Barr in a Dec. 10 speech) to analyze the non-price effects of competition is a remarkable development that bears watching.</p><p>While some privacy advocates have expressed concern about allowing data collection to happen in the first place, there are others who seem frustrated by the inequality presented by data collection and the potential for marketplace exclusion. For example, during the recent DOJ review of the Paramount Consent Decrees, the decades-old rules governing the relationship between movie studios and theater chains, Michigan State University law professor Adam Candeub submitted a comment critical of Netflix to the antitrust office. \"Netflix does everything in its power to prevent third parties from learning its viewing data,\" he wrote. \"Netflix encrypts its data to prevent ISPs and web browsers from tracking the use, and it does not share any data with third parties, even the studios whose material it licenses and who naturally want information on [their] own show[s]. While Netflix has a right to its own data ... Netflix goes a step too far by using its market power in the [online video] market to require that connected devices not use available data.\"</p><p>Similarly, in a July 31 letter from the Artist Rights Alliance to the DOJ and the House Judiciary Committee, the musicians' group laid out a number of concerns about specific tech companies, including Amazon. \"The antitrust problems created by Amazon's role as both a distributor in its own right and a platform for other sellers and services are well understood,\" stated the letter. \"The company's massive data stockpiles and ability to monitor its competitors from 'inside' their own transactions and operations threaten genuine competition in virtually every sector of the U.S. economy. Amazon's ongoing efforts to launch a streaming music service as part of its Prime family of products should be carefully scrutinized as part of your review. While more competition is always welcome and Amazon Music is a royalty-paying service, we are concerned about the dangers of predatory/ sub-market pricing in a service that Amazon operates as a 'loss leader.'\"</p><p>If regulators decide to crack down, a side squabble would erupt over how to remedy the competitive harms arising from data collection. Among the possibilities is that data aggregation could become a significant issue when companies seek approval for mergers. Reuters reported Dec. 10 that the DOJ is examining whether to block Google's proposed acquisition of Fitbit on the grounds that it would give Google too much data about American consumers. Regulators also could look to force data-sharing in some instances. A separate Reuters story reported that the Financial Stability Board, an international body that monitors the global financial system, would soon recommend that big tech firms be required to promote sharing of data.</p><p>Now imagine if the DOJ ever dared to stop two streaming video companies from merging on grounds of having too much information about what Americans watched. Or picture a scenario in which Netflix and Disney+ were forced to share audited consumption data with the creative talents that produce and star in their shows.</p><p>Some observers, noting a lack of legal precedent and any empirical evidence about the competitive harms from data hoarding, are urging regulators to be cautious. A recent law review article by University of Florida professor D. Daniel Sokol addressed the debate over whether antitrust law has a role to play, with the conclusion that \"antitrust intervention over market forces threatens consumer welfare, especially in fast-moving markets, and proposed remedies, such as limiting the collection and use of Big Data or forcing large firms to share with rivals, are likely to harm competition and innovation, and in fact may raise privacy concerns.\"</p><p>Truth be told, there's no indication yet that regulators are prepared to do anything more than conduct a review of data collection. Time will tell whether the talk about getting tough is really just frustration at not being able to do more to punish tech companies for other perceived sins (i.e., an indifference to privacy, ideological biases or sheer chutzpah).</p><p>But as Hollywood launches new digital platforms amid an appetite to police data collection, comments like those from Candeub and the Artist Rights Alliance may best be viewed as demonstrating the types of complaints that could become more commonplace in the years ahead for the streaming economy. As such, the industry is advised to think hard about the answer to these two questions: When it comes to measuring how individuals are consuming entertainment, would the data collection be less likely to occur if such data wasn't a secret and could be used by business partners and corporate rivals? If transparency presents a problem, why is that?</p><p>ERIQ GARDNER is senior editor, law and policy, at The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p>Please Note: Illustration(s) are not available due to copyright restrictions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASAPII-611547637</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 611547637</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YM5-F1Y1-JCBJ-K0H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">140610</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Prometheus Global Media LLC</copyright><publicationName>Hollywood Reporter</publicationName><issn>ISSN: 0018-3660</issn><volume>Vol. 426</volume><issueNumber>No. 1\"</issueNumber><aggregationName>ASAP</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 3, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Other, Magazine/Journal</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Aggregate News Sources</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>United States</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.product\"><classificationItem><className>Motion Pictures</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Privacy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumer Behavior</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust Law</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Arts and entertainment industries</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business, international</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Antitrust law</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Computer services industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Consumer behavior</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Data collection</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Data entry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Forecasts and trends</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Information technology services industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Motion picture industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Movie industry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Privacy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Streaming media</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.general-terms\"><classificationItem><className>Forecasts, trends, outlooks</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Antitrust &amp;

However, for privacy campaigners it's part of a \"Big Brother\" moment for healthcare, where patients' sacrosanct information becomes a commodity traded between healthcare providers and commercial entities.</p><p>It was a fear crystallised in July when the NHS was found to have illegally handed 1.6 million patient records - including information such as HIV status, mental health history and abortions - to Google's artificial intelligence company DeepMind.</p><p>The UK's information commissioner reprimanded the London NHS Trust involved and the Silicon Valley tech giant for failing to comply with data protection rules.</p><p>\"This is not just some sort of generic privacy concern,\" says Phil Booth of campaign group MedConfidential.</p><p>\"It's about confidentiality. There's a necessity for it. It's at the heart of the doctor-patient relationship and the whole health system relies on it. We need a frank debate about these issues.\"</p><p>UK drug makers have been most keen to emphasise the upside of big data. The industry has been shouting about its potential since at least 2013, when in a paper entitled the \"Big data road map\", trade body the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) outlined potential benefits including \"improved patient health\" and reduced costs for the NHS.</p><p>AstraZeneca has plans to map 2m genomes within a decade</p><p>The government arguably cottoned on even earlier, with David Cameron, the prime minister at the time, launching the 100,000 Genomes Project at the end of 2012. Already 30,000 people's DNA has been tested, providing invaluable data for the NHS and select commercial partners.</p><p>In the intervening years British biotechs have been springing up in the fertile space between drug development and big data, including genomics data specialists Congencia and Eagle, while firms like E-Therapeutics use artificial intelligence to help discover new medicines.</p><p>Not to be outdone, FTSE 100 behemoth AstraZeneca has plans to map 2m genomes within a decade.</p><p>Dr Jurgi Camblong, founder and chief executive of Sophia, says his firm could ultimately map the genomes of 50m cancer patients alone a year, helping identify the genetic traits that contribute to the disease.</p><p>He hopes more data sharing will lead to positive behavioural change in healthcare provision.</p><p>\"My father was sick and for my mother it was a nightmare,\" he says. \"He had repeated MRI scans in different hospitals because they each couldn't access the data. That's a terrible use of healthcare funds.</p><p>\"We need to break down these silos. It's not a tech problem, it's a mentality concern.\"</p><p>It's not just pharmaceutical firms joining the data rush. Big tech companies have also made clear their intention to move into healthcare, including Google and Apple.</p><p>As well as DeepMind's work with the NHS, Google's sister life sciences company, Verily, is ploughing money into European health ventures, including a bioelectronic medicine tie-up with Britain's biggest drugs firm GSK.</p><p>Apple unveiled an extension of the health monitoring capabilities of its third generation iWatch products this week amid the circus of its $1,000 iPhone X launch.</p><p>Stem cells being stored in a Brazilian genome research centreCredit:      Andre Penner / AP     </p><p>Apple said it is now working with Stanford University and US medicines agencies to develop iWatch tests for heart arrhythmias.</p><p>Reports on both sides of the pond have already credited the product with no less than saving lives, with cases of people being alerted to dangerous jumps in their heart rate and seeking vital medical help in the nick of time.</p><p>The popularity of Fitbit wristbands further demonstrates the blurring between wearable wellness technology and medical devices, although a bona fide move into the latter field by tech firms would mean clearing much more strict regulatory hurdles.</p><p>Amid all the excitement, MedConfidential's Booth sounds a warning: \"There's a big rush towards big data.

However, for privacy campaigners it's part of a \"Big Brother\" moment for healthcare, where patients' sacrosanct information becomes a commodity traded between healthcare providers and commercial entities.</p><p>It was a fear crystallised in July when the NHS was found to have illegally handed 1.6 million patient records - including information such as HIV status, mental health history and abortions - to Google's artificial intelligence company DeepMind.</p><p>The UK's information commissioner reprimanded the London NHS Trust involved and the Silicon Valley tech giant for failing to comply with data protection rules.</p><p>\"This is not just some sort of generic privacy concern,\" says Phil Booth of campaign group MedConfidential.</p><p>\"It's about confidentiality. There's a necessity for it. It's at the heart of the doctor-patient relationship and the whole health system relies on it. We need a frank debate about these issues.\"UK drug makers have been most keen to emphasise the upside of big data. The industry has been shouting about its potential since at least 2013, when in a paper entitled the \"Big data road map\", trade body the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI) outlined potential benefits including \"improved patient health\" and reduced costs for the NHS.</p><p>The government arguably cottoned on even earlier, with David Cameron, the prime minister at the time, launching the 100,000 Genomes Project at the end of 2012. Already 30,000 people's DNA has been tested, providing invaluable data for the NHS and select commercial partners.</p><p>In the intervening years British biotechs have been springing up in the fertile space between drug development and big data, including genomics data specialists Congencia and Eagle, while firms like E-Therapeutics use artificial intelligence to help discover new medicines.</p><p>Not to be outdone, FTSE 100 behemoth AstraZeneca has plans to map 2m genomes within a decade.</p><p>Dr Jurgi Camblong, founder and chief executive of Sophia, says his firm could ultimately map the genomes of 50m cancer patients alone a year, helping identify the genetic traits that contribute to the disease. He hopes more data sharing will lead to positive behavioural change in healthcare provision.</p><p>\"My father was sick and for my mother it was a nightmare,\" he says. \"He had repeated MRI scans in different hospitals because they each couldn't access the data. That's a terrible use of healthcare funds.</p><p>\"We need to break down these silos. It's not a tech problem, it's a mentality concern.\"</p><p>It's not just pharmaceutical firms joining the data rush. Big tech companies have also made clear their intention to move into healthcare, including Google and Apple.</p><p>As well as DeepMind's work with the NHS, Google's sister life sciences company, Verily, is ploughing money into European health ventures, including a bioelectronic medicine tie-up with Britain's biggest drugs firm GSK.</p><p>Apple unveiled an extension of the health monitoring capabilities of its third generation iWatch products this week amid the circus of its $1,000 iPhone X launch.</p><p>Apple said it is now working with Stanford University and US medicines agencies to develop iWatch tests for heart arrhythmias.</p><p>Reports on both sides of the pond have already credited the product with no less than saving lives, with cases of people being alerted to dangerous jumps in their heart rate and seeking vital medical help in the nick of time. The popularity of Fitbit wristbands further demonstrates the blurring between wearable wellness technology and medical devices, although a bona fide move into the latter field by tech firms would mean clearing much more strict regulatory hurdles.</p><p>Amid all the excitement, MedConfidential's Booth sounds a warning: \"There's a big rush towards big data. But let's not forget these are some of the most sensitive data about people's lives. It's not something health providers should siphon off or look to turn a buck on.\" Richard Dickinson, a partner in data privacy at law firm APKS, points out more onerous EU data protection regulations will come into force next year, requiring more explicit consent for a range of data sharing practices.</p><p>Coupled with high fines of up to 20pc of global turnover for breaches, he says privacy is \"really focusing people's minds\".</p><p>He warns even anonymised clinical data can be problematic under data protection law if it \"can be reverse engineered\" to identify the person who supplied it.</p><p>While he is positive about the potential applications for data for healthcare, he also warns of a range of dystopian-sounding scenarios if health data are ever misplaced.</p><p>\"If people learn I have certain genetic traits and perhaps am more prone to illness, it might be that my insurance liabilities go up, I may miss out on company health cover, my wife may no longer want to have kids with me or I might be barred from entering certain countries,\" he says.</p><p>He suggests tech firms that are not as used to dealing with sensitive health information as their counterparts in pharmaceuticals might be more likely to fall foul of data protection law.</p><p>Despite the assurances of safeguards from companies, the potential risks were exposed by the Petya cyberattack in June, with US drugmaking giant Merck one of the victims of the hack.</p><p>While there was no suggestion patient data had been compromised, the $10bn revenue firm admitted a month later that shipping of some products had been delayed and was forced to cut its profits outlook.</p><p>Dr Camblong says that because the data supplied to Sophia are anonymised the legal responsibility for obtaining consent lies with the hospitals that supply it data.

One analyst sees BIDU going to $215 per share in the next 12 months. That represents roughly a 125% increase from current levels.</p><p><br/> Many market commentators at the most popular financial websites are similarly bullish. One of the commentators in a recent article called Baidu \"the biggest bargain in big tech.\" Another claims that Baidu is \"the best stock for 2013.\"<br/> A quick evaluation of Baidu makes it easy to understand the reason for all the optimism.<br/> First of all, Baidu - with roughly an 80% search-engine market share - is well positioned to benefit from the rapid Internet adoption rate in the lucrative Chinese market. Second, BIDU sports an incredibly strong balance sheet, with a current ratio of 3.6, long-term debt to equity of 0.15, and intangibles to total assets of 0.17. From a valuation standpoint, BIDU looks very attractive, with a forward PEG ratio of 0.53.<br/> But a closer look reveals a very important - and largely ignored - risk that investors should consider before jumping on the Baidu bandwagon. That is the risk associated with the company's VIE structure.<br/>The VIE Structure<br/>When you purchase shares of Baidu, you're not assuming direct ownership of the company, as you would if you purchased shares in a US company like, let's say, Google[1] or Apple[2]. Rather, you're buying shares in what the legal minds at Robins, Kaplan, Miller Ciresi refer to as \"an offshore holding company or shell company whose entire viability hinges on the soundness of its contracts with its Chinese operating company counterpart.\"<br/> This is what is known as a \"variable interest entity\" (VIE) structure; it is commonly used by Chinese companies as a way to sidestep China's ban on foreign investment in certain economic sectors (e.g., the Internet, media, and telecom). Some of the more familiar names that have adopted the VIE structure include: Yoku.com, RenRen, New Oriental Education, Sina, and 21Vianet Group.<br/> One major flaw with the VIE structure is that the various contracts and legal agreements between the shell company and the wholly owned Chinese operating company may not be enforceable under Chinese law. And this - as the law firm Robins\u00a0et al.\u00a0points out - \"exposes foreign investors to the risk that Chinese VIEs may readily breach their contracts with their U.S.-listed counterparts if this serves the VIE's interests, because Chinese courts will not enforce these contracts against the VIE anyway.\"<br/> It may happen infrequently, but VIEs do sometimes breach their contracts with the holding company. Once the market becomes aware that a holding company has \"lost control of the VIE,\" shares go into a tailspin, giving shareholders little time to react. So in a sense, VIE stocks can be a ticking time bomb.<br/>Cautionary Tales<br/>In early 2008, shares of the PRC seed producer Agria Corporation sank roughly 50% in a matter of days when it was announced that Agria was losing control of its Chinese VIE. The issue was with a Chinese executive at the VIE who became disgruntled at not having received certain compensation for services to the holding company that he believed was owed to him and his management team. The dispute was eventually resolved (and the VIE remained intact) when Agria essentially met the demands of the executive by granting him and other members of management \"a significant amount of shares in the offshore parent as well as cash compensation for services rendered to the company.\" But shareholders didn't fare so well; Agria shares never recovered, presumably because investors lost confidence in the company's corporate structure.<br/> Another high-profile example of loss of control over a VIE involved GigaMedia. In early 2010, GigaMedia decided to part ways with a Chinese executive who ran (and largely controlled) its VIE. In an act of defiance, the Chinese executive - emboldened by the fact that he would probably face no legal repercussions - refused to surrender his personal ownership of the Chinese operating licenses for the VIEs  licenses essential to GigaMedia's business in China. Despite suing the executive in multiple jurisdictions, including in China, GigaMedia wasn't able to fully regain control of its VIE. GigaMedia shares lost more than half their value as a result.<br/> It is important to note that the scenarios above are less likely to happen to Baidu, which has certain safeguards in place to somewhat minimize the risk of losing control of its VIEs. For example, the Chinese executive Yanhong Li, who largely controls Baidu's VIEs, also has a significant stake in the offshore holding company (BIDU). This serves to align his interests with that of the foreign shareholders, making for a more solid VIE structure. But even with that structure in place, there can be a contagion effect when other companies experience problems with their VIEs. For instance, in May of 2011, Baidu shares fell nearly 30% following the announcement that Alibaba had lost its VIE.<br/> The threat of contagion pales in comparison to the threat that Chinese regulators can at any time decide to shut down a VIE. This is what happened to Buddha Steel in March 2011, when it abruptly canceled its proposed public offering in the United States, citing that the company \"was advised by local governmental authorities in Hebei Province that [its VIE structure contractual control arrangements] contravene current Chinese management policies related to foreign-invested enterprises and, as a result, are against public policy.\"<br/> Some have speculated that Buddha Steel was targeted merely because it competed against state-owned steel companies. But others see something more ominous - a potentially broad Chinese government crackdown on the whole VIE structure. Whatever the case may be, one thing is for sure: the Buddha Steel case exposed the vulnerability of the VIE structure whenever it faces regulatory scrutiny in China.<br/>Our Final Take on Baidu<br/>Ultimately, the Baidu bulls' claims that shares will surge from current levels may prove to be correct. But because of its VIE structure, Baidu is decidedly not the kind of blue-chip stock many are touting it as. Instead, it's a far more speculative investment, and it should be treated as such.<br/> In\u00a0Big Tech[3], we tend to shy away from such speculative and potentially disastrous investments as Baidu. Instead, we focus on the rock-solid stocks that can be counted on to deliver 20%+ annual gains.

You've heard it from Big Business lackeys in both political parties.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And you've heard it from journalists, pundits and think-tankers ad nauseam: The H-1B foreign guest worker program, they claim, requires American employers to first show that they searched for and tried to recruit American workers before tapping an ever-growing government-rigged pipeline of cheap foreign workers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The foot soldiers of the open borders brigade are lying, deluded, ignorant or bought-off. On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee brought top independent academics and informed whistleblowers to Washington to expose the truth. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, hosted Howard University associate professor of public policy Ron Hira, Rutgers University professor Hal Salzman, Infosys whistleblower Jay Palmer and former computer programmer-turned-lawyer John Miano, who brought much-needed reality checks on the systemic betrayal of American workers to the Beltway table.</p><p> Miano's testimony was particularly important because he explained how the little known \"OPT\" (Optical Training Program) for foreign students is being used to circumvent H-1B and supply large corporations with cheap foreign labor. President Obama has expanded this regulatory program by unfettered administrative fiat.</p><p> As Miano noted: \"OPT has no labor protections of any kind.</p><p> Aliens on OPT do not even have to be paid at all. While DHS requires aliens to work in an area related to their major area of study, DHS has no ability to ensure that this happens.</p><p> Under OPT, over 125,000 foreign workers a year are simply turned loose in America with no supervision or restrictions.\" Also on hand at the hearing: a few Big Tech shills toeing the Zuckerberg/Gates/Chamber of Commerce line that there's a catastrophic American tech worker shortage, even as thousands upon thousands of American workers are being laid offin favor of underpaid, easily exploited H-1Bs. (Just use H-1B-promoter Google's search engine and type in \"Southern California Edison\" and \"layoffs.\") Grassley put it plainly: \"Most people believe that employers are supposed to recruit Americans before they petition for an H-1B worker. Yet, under the law, most employers are not required to prove to the Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the job first.\" He added, \"And, if there is an equally or even better qualified U. S. worker available, the company does not have to offer him or her the job. Over the years, the program has become a government assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over - rather than complement - the U. S. workforce.\" Hira affirmed: \"It's absolutely not true\" that employers seeking H-1Bs must put American workers first, either by \"law or regulations.\" How did this myth gain such traction? Many commentators and journalists confuse the labor certification process required for companies applying to obtain green cards (lawful permanent residency status) for H-1B workers with the Labor Condition Application (LCA) process for H-1Bs. Labor certification in the green card process \"exists to protect U. S. workers and the U. S. labor market by ensuring that foreign workers seeking immigrant visa classifications are not displacing equally qualified U. S. workers.\" Only in extremely narrow and exceptional circumstances do these nominal protections exist in the H-1B LCA process. (Companies must be classified as \"H-1B dependent\" for the requirements to apply. Big Tech giants like Facebook have been lobbying mightily to avoid the classification.) And even those narrow exceptions are easily and often circumvented by H-1B foreign worker traffickers.</p><p> Conservative journalist W. James Antle gets to the heart of the matter: \"If the government has discretion in how it exercises its legitimate authority over who comes and who goes, a prerequisite for national sovereignty, then shouldn't it exercise such discretion in a way that minimizes the impoverishment of Americans?\" For a very brief window, Grassley and, yes, Sen. Bernie Sanders, IVt., a small group of H-1B-employing banks and other financial institutions that accepted federal bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) did have to demonstrate that they had taken \"good-faith steps to recruit U. S. workers\" and offer them wages \"at least as high\" as those offered to H-1B workers. In addition, the targeted employers had to show that they \"must not have laid off, and will not lay off, any U. S. worker in a job essentially equivalent to the H-1B position in the area of intended employment of the H-1B worker\" within a narrow time frame.</p><p> But this American worker-first provision, vociferously opposed by Big Business and Big Government, expired in 2011. The refusal of the vast majority of politicians and the White House to embrace these protections for all U. S. workers tells you everything you need to know about H-1B's big, fat lies.</p><p> Michelle Malkin is the author of \"Culture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies\" (Regnery 2010).

You\u2019ve heard it from Big Business lackeys in both political parties. And you\u2019ve heard it from journalists, pundits and think-tankers ad nauseam:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The H-1B foreign guest worker program, they claim, requires American employers to first show that they searched for and tried to recruit American workers before tapping an ever-growing government-rigged pipeline of cheap foreign workers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The foot soldiers of the open-borders brigade are lying, deluded, ignorant or bought-off.</p><p> On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee brought top independent academics and informed whistleblowers to Washington to expose the truth. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) hosted Howard University associate professor of public policy Ron Hira, Rutgers University professor Hal Salzman, Infosys whistleblower Jay Palmer and former computer programmer-turned-lawyer John Miano, who brought much-needed reality checks on the systemic betrayal of American workers to the Beltway table.</p><p> Miano\u2019s testimony was particularly important because he explained how the little known \u201cOPT\u201d (Optical Training Program) for foreign students is being used to circumvent H-1B and supply large corporations with cheap foreign labor. President Obama has expanded this regulatory program by unfettered administrative fiat. As Miano noted: \u201cOPT has no labor protections of any kind. Aliens on OPT do not even have to be paid at all. While DHS requires aliens to work in an area related to their major area of study, DHS has no ability to ensure that this happens. Under OPT, over 125,000 foreign workers a year are simply turned loose in America with no supervision or restrictions.\u201d</p><p> Also on hand at the hearing: a few Big Tech shills toeing the Zuckerberg/Gates/Chamber of Commerce line that there\u2019s a catastrophic American tech worker shortage, even as thousands upon thousands of American workers are being laid off in favor of underpaid, easily exploited H-1Bs. (Just use H-1B-promoter Google\u2019s search engine and type in \u201cSouthern California Edison\u201d and \u201clayoffs.\u201d)</p><p> Grassley put it plainly: \u201cMost people believe that employers are supposed to recruit Americans before they petition for an H-1B worker. Yet, under the law, most employers are not required to prove to the Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the job first.\u201d</p><p> He added, \u201cAnd, if there is an equally or even better qualified U.S. worker available, the company does not have to offer him or her the job. Over the years, the program has become a government-assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over \u2014 rather than complement \u2014 the U.S. workforce.\u201d</p><p> Hira affirmed: \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely not true\u201d that employers seeking H-1Bs must put American workers first, either by \u201claw or regulations.\u201d</p><p> How did this myth gain such traction? Many commentators and journalists confuse the labor certification process required for companies applying to obtain green cards (lawful permanent residency status) for H-1B workers with the Labor Condition Application process for H-1Bs. Labor certification in the green card process \u201cexists to protect U.S. workers and the U.S. labor market by ensuring that foreign workers seeking immigrant visa classifications are not displacing equally qualified U.S. workers.\u201d Only in extremely narrow and exceptional circumstances do these nominal protections exist in the H-1B LCA process. (Companies must be classified as \u201cH-1B dependent\u201d for the requirements to apply. Big Tech giants like Facebook have been lobbying mightily to avoid the classification.) And even those narrow exceptions are easily and often circumvented by H-1B foreign worker traffickers.</p><p> Conservative journalist W. James Antle gets to the heart of the matter: \u201cIf the government has discretion in how it exercises its legitimate authority over who comes and who goes, a prerequisite for national sovereignty, then shouldn\u2019t it exercise such discretion in a way that minimizes the impoverishment of Americans?\u201d</p><p> For a very brief window, Grassley and, yes, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) a small group of H-1B-employing banks and other financial institutions that accepted federal bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program did have to demonstrate that they had taken \u201cgood-faith steps to recruit U.S. workers\u201d and offer them wages \u201cat least as high\u201d as those offered to H-1B workers. In addition, the targeted employers had to show that they \u201cmust not have laid off, and will not lay off, any U.S. worker in a job essentially equivalent to the H-1B position in the area of intended employment of the H-1B worker\u201d within a narrow time frame.</p><p> But this American worker-first provision, vociferously opposed by Big Business and Big Government, expired in 2011. The refusal of the vast majority of politicians and the White House to embrace these protections for all U.S. workers tells you everything you need to know about H-1B\u2019s big, fat lies.</p><p> Michelle Malkin is the author of \u201cCulture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies\u201d (Regnery 2010).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWBKGA-26533939</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">0F2898F303CFBB00 NWBKGA2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FJT-B0N1-JD6S-R4VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">399546</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-11-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"852\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Cherokee Neighbor<br/>Distributed by Newsbank, Inc.

You've heard it from Big Business lackeys in both political parties. </p><p>And you've heard it from journalists, pundits and think-tankers ad nauseam: The H-1B foreign guest worker program, they claim, requires American employers to first show that they searched for and tried to recruit American workers before tapping an ever-growing government-rigged pipeline of cheap foreign workers. The foot soldiers of the open-borders brigade are lying, deluded, ignorant or bought-off. On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee brought top independent academics and informed whistleblowers to Washington to expose the truth. Sen. <person><nameText>Charles Grassley, </nameText></person>R-Iowa, hosted Howard University associate professor of public policy Ron Hira, Rutgers University professor Hal Salzman, Infosys whistleblower Jay Palmer and former computer programmer-turned-lawyer John Miano, who brought much-needed reality checks on the systemic betrayal of American workers to the Beltway table. Miano's testimony was particularly important because he explained how the little known 'OPT' (Optical Training Program) for foreign students is being used to circumvent H-1B and supply large corporations with cheap foreign labor. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>has expanded this regulatory program by unfettered administrative fiat. As Miano noted: 'OPT has no labor protections of any kind. Aliens on OPT do not even have to be paid at all. While DHS requires aliens to work in an area related to their major area of study, DHS has no ability to ensure that this happens. Under OPT, over 125,000 foreign workers a year are simply turned loose in America with no supervision or restrictions.' Also on hand at the hearing: a few Big Tech shills toeing the Zuckerberg/Gates/Chamber of Commerce line that there's a catastrophic American tech worker shortage, even as thousands upon thousands of American workers are being laid off in favor of underpaid, easily exploited H-1Bs. (Just use H-1B-promoter Google's search engine and type in 'Southern California Edison' and 'layoffs.') Grassley put it plainly: 'Most people believe that employers are supposed to recruit Americans before they petition for an H-1B worker. Yet, under the law, most employers are not required to prove to the Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the job first.' He added, 'And, if there is an equally or even better qualified U.S. worker available, the company does not have to offer him or her the job. Over the years, the program has become a government-assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over   rather than complement   the U.S. workforce.' Hira affirmed: 'It's absolutely not true' that employers seeking H-1Bs must put American workers first, either by 'law or regulations.' How did this myth gain such traction? Many commentators and journalists confuse the labor certification process required for companies applying to obtain green cards (lawful permanent residency status) for H-1B workers with the Labor Condition Application (LCA) process for H-1Bs. Labor certification in the green card process 'exists to protect U.S. workers and the U.S. labor market by ensuring that foreign workers seeking immigrant visa classifications are not displacing equally qualified U.S. workers.' Only in extremely narrow and exceptional circumstances do these nominal protections exist in the H-1B LCA process. (Companies must be classified as 'H-1B dependent' for the requirements to apply. Big Tech giants like Facebook have been lobbying mightily to avoid the classification.) And even those narrow exceptions are easily and often circumvented by H-1B foreign worker traffickers. Conservative journalist W. James Antle gets to the heart of the matter: 'If the government has discretion in how it exercises its legitimate authority over who comes and who goes, a prerequisite for national sovereignty, then shouldn't it exercise such discretion in a way that minimizes the impoverishment of Americans?' For a very brief window, Grassley and, yes, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., a small group of H-1B-employing banks and other financial institutions that accepted federal bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) did have to demonstrate that they had taken 'good-faith steps to recruit U.S. workers' and offer them wages 'at least as high' as those offered to H-1B workers. In addition, the targeted employers had to show that they 'must not have laid off, and will not lay off, any U.S. worker in a job essentially equivalent to the H-1B position in the area of intended employment of the H-1B worker' within a narrow time frame. But this American worker-first provision, vociferously opposed by Big Business and Big Government, expired in 2011. The refusal of the vast majority of politicians and the White House to embrace these protections for all U.S. workers tells you everything you need to know about H-1B's big, fat lies.

You've heard it from Big Business lackeys in both political parties. And you've heard it from journalists, pundits and think-tankers ad nauseam:&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;The H-1B foreign guest worker program, they claim, requires American employers to first show that they searched for and tried to recruit American workers before tapping an ever-growing government-rigged pipeline of cheap foreign workers.&lt;nl/&gt;       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://d2rg8jfniu44sp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Michelle-Malkin.jpg&lt;nl/&gt;\">http://d2rg8jfniu44sp.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Michelle-Malkin.jpg&lt;nl/&gt;</url> The foot soldiers of the open-borders brigade are lying, deluded, ignorant or bought-off.&lt;nl/&gt;</p><p> On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee brought top independent academics and informed whistleblowers to Washington to expose the truth. Sen. <person><nameText>Charles Grassley, </nameText></person>R-Iowa, hosted Howard University associate professor of public policy Ron Hira, Rutgers University professor Hal Salzman, Infosys whistleblower Jay Palmer and former computer programmer-turned-lawyer John Miano, who brought much-needed reality checks on the systemic betrayal of American workers to the Beltway table.&lt;nl/&gt;&lt;nl/&gt;Miano's testimony was particularly important because he explained how the little known 'OPT' (Optical Training Program) for foreign students is being used to circumvent H-1B and supply large corporations with cheap foreign labor. President Obama has expanded this regulatory program by unfettered administrative fiat. As Miano noted: 'OPT has no labor protections of any kind. Aliens on OPT do not even have to be paid at all. While DHS requires aliens to work in an area related to their major area of study, DHS has no ability to ensure that this happens. Under OPT, over 125,000 foreign workers a year are simply turned loose in America with no supervision or restrictions.'&lt;nl/&gt; Also on hand at the hearing: a few Big Tech shills toeing the Zuckerberg/Gates/Chamber of Commerce line that there's a catastrophic American tech worker shortage, even as thousands upon thousands of American workers are being laid off in favor of underpaid, easily exploited H-1Bs. (Just use H-1B-promoter Google's search engine and type in 'Southern California Edison' and 'layoffs.')&lt;nl/&gt; Grassley put it plainly: 'Most people believe that employers are supposed to recruit Americans before they petition for an H-1B worker. Yet, under the law, most employers are not required to prove to the Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the job first.'&lt;nl/&gt; He added, 'And, if there is an equally or even better qualified U.S. worker available, the company does not have to offer him or her the job. Over the years, the program has become a government-assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over \u2014 rather than complement \u2014 the U.S. workforce.'&lt;nl/&gt; Hira affirmed: 'It's absolutely not true' that employers seeking H-1Bs must put American workers first, either by 'law or regulations.'&lt;nl/&gt; How did this myth gain such traction? Many commentators and journalists confuse the labor certification process required for companies applying to obtain green cards (lawful permanent residency status) for H-1B workers with the Labor Condition Application (LCA) process for H-1Bs. Labor certification in the green card process 'exists to protect U.S. workers and the U.S. labor market by ensuring that foreign workers seeking immigrant visa classifications are not displacing equally qualified U.S. workers.' Only in extremely narrow and exceptional circumstances do these nominal protections exist in the H-1B LCA process. (Companies must be classified as 'H-1B dependent' for the requirements to apply. Big Tech giants like Facebook have been lobbying mightily to avoid the classification.) And even those narrow exceptions are easily and often circumvented by H-1B foreign worker traffickers.&lt;nl/&gt; Conservative journalist W. James Antle gets to the heart of the matter: 'If the government has discretion in how it exercises its legitimate authority over who comes and who goes, a prerequisite for national sovereignty, then shouldn't it exercise such discretion in a way that minimizes the impoverishment of Americans?'&lt;nl/&gt; For a very brief window, Grassley and, yes, Sen. <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>I-Vt., a small group of H-1B-employing banks and other financial institutions that accepted federal bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) did have to demonstrate that they had taken 'good-faith steps to recruit U.S. workers' and offer them wages 'at least as high' as those offered to H-1B workers. In addition, the targeted employers had to show that they 'must not have laid off, and will not lay off, any U.S. worker in a job essentially equivalent to the H-1B position in the area of intended employment of the H-1B worker' within a narrow time frame.&lt;nl/&gt; But this American worker-first provision, vociferously opposed by Big Business and Big Government, expired in 2011. The refusal of the vast majority of politicians and the White House to embrace these protections for all U.S. workers tells you everything you need to know about H-1B's big, fat lies.&lt;nl/&gt; Michelle Malkin is the author of 'Culture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies' (Regnery 2010).

You've heard it from Big Business lackeys in both political parties. </p><p>And you've heard it from journalists, pundits and think-tankers ad nauseam:&lt;nl/&gt; The H-1B foreign guest worker program, they claim, requires American employers to first show that they searched for and tried to recruit American workers before tapping an ever-growing government-rigged pipeline of cheap foreign workers.&lt;nl/&gt; The foot soldiers of the open-borders brigade are lying, deluded, ignorant or bought-off.&lt;nl/&gt; On Tuesday, the Senate Judiciary Committee brought top independent academics and informed whistleblowers to Washington to expose the truth. Sen. <person><nameText>Charles Grassley, </nameText></person>R-Iowa, hosted Howard University associate professor of public policy Ron Hira, Rutgers University professor Hal Salzman, Infosys whistleblower Jay Palmer and former computer programmer-turned-lawyer John Miano, who brought much-needed reality checks on the systemic betrayal of American workers to the Beltway table.&lt;nl/&gt; Miano's testimony was particularly important because he explained how the little known 'OPT' (Optical Training Program) for foreign students is being used to circumvent H-1B and supply large corporations with cheap foreign labor. <person><nameText>President Obama </nameText></person>has expanded this regulatory program by unfettered administrative fiat.&lt;nl/&gt; As Miano noted: 'OPT has no labor protections of any kind. Aliens on OPT do not even have to be paid at all. While DHS requires aliens to work in an area related to their major area of study, DHS has no ability to ensure that this happens. Under OPT, over 125,000 foreign workers a year are simply turned loose in America with no supervision or restrictions.'&lt;nl/&gt; Also on hand at the hearing: a few Big Tech shills toeing the Zuckerberg/Gates/Chamber of Commerce line that there's a catastrophic American tech worker shortage, even as thousands upon thousands of American workers are being laid off in favor of underpaid, easily exploited H-1Bs. (Just use H-1B-promoter Google's search engine and type in 'Southern California Edison' and 'layoffs.')&lt;nl/&gt; Grassley put it plainly: 'Most people believe that employers are supposed to recruit Americans before they petition for an H-1B worker. Yet, under the law, most employers are not required to prove to the Department of Labor that they tried to find an American to fill the job first.'&lt;nl/&gt; He added, 'And, if there is an equally or even better qualified U.S. worker available, the company does not have to offer him or her the job. Over the years, the program has become a government-assisted way for employers to bring in cheaper foreign labor, and now it appears these foreign workers take over \u2014 rather than complement \u2014 the U.S. workforce.'&lt;nl/&gt; Hira affirmed: 'It's absolutely not true' that employers seeking H-1Bs must put American workers first, either by 'law or regulations.'&lt;nl/&gt; How did this myth gain such traction? Many commentators and journalists confuse the labor certification process required for companies applying to obtain green cards (lawful permanent residency status) for H-1B workers with the Labor Condition Application (LCA) process for H-1Bs. Labor certification in the green card process 'exists to protect U.S. workers and the U.S. labor market by ensuring that foreign workers seeking immigrant visa classifications are not displacing equally qualified U.S. workers.' Only in extremely narrow and exceptional circumstances do these nominal protections exist in the H-1B LCA process. (Companies must be classified as 'H-1B dependent' for the requirements to apply. Big Tech giants like Facebook have been lobbying mightily to avoid the classification.) And even those narrow exceptions are easily and often circumvented by H-1B foreign worker traffickers.&lt;nl/&gt; Conservative journalist W. James Antle gets to the heart of the matter: 'If the government has discretion in how it exercises its legitimate authority over who comes and who goes, a prerequisite for national sovereignty, then shouldn't it exercise such discretion in a way that minimizes the impoverishment of Americans?'&lt;nl/&gt; For a very brief window, Grassley and, yes, Sen. <person><nameText>Bernie Sanders, </nameText></person>I-Vt., a small group of H-1B-employing banks and other financial institutions that accepted federal bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) did have to demonstrate that they had taken 'good-faith steps to recruit U.S. workers' and offer them wages 'at least as high' as those offered to H-1B workers. In addition, the targeted employers had to show that they 'must not have laid off, and will not lay off, any U.S. worker in a job essentially equivalent to the H-1B position in the area of intended employment of the H-1B worker' within a narrow time frame.&lt;nl/&gt; But this American worker-first provision, vociferously opposed by Big Business and Big Government, expired in 2011. The refusal of the vast majority of politicians and the White House to embrace these protections for all U.S. workers tells you everything you need to know about H-1B's big, fat lies.&lt;nl/&gt; Michelle Malkin is the author of 'Culture of Corruption: Obama and his Team of Tax Cheats, Crooks and Cronies' (Regnery 2010).

Using a once-benign law, the 1926 Federal Arbitration Act, which was given new corporate teeth by right-wing courts, an employer can today demand that a worker sign away a range of rights as a condition of employment. Consumers who purchase possibly defective products are put in the same position by corporate sellers. Under clauses in consumer and employment contracts, disputes must be referred to an arbitrator chosen by the company, and class action suits are prohibited. </p><p>However, galvanized by the #MeToo movement, workers have organized[2] for[3] and won[4] concessions at workplaces like Google[5] over ending forced arbitration for sexual harassment claims, which places disputes in a secret tribunal and represents an obstacle to stopping systemic misconduct.New York[6]state prohibited mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims in April, and California isattempting a broader ban[7]in employment contracts. While nationallegislation[8]to prohibit forced arbitration has a dim chance of passing as long as Republicans have a say, Lindsey Graham (R-SC) didlead a hearing[9]on the subject in April, expressing support for reform. And Elizabeth Warren's presidential campaign hasendorsed[10]making federal contractors that use arbitration clauses ineligible for contracts, which would cover a substantial segment of industry. To break the arbitration debate more into the mainstream, one company should really garner more attention as a serial abuser of the arbitration process\u2014Amazon.  ALL OF AMAZON'Sthird-party sellers, responsible for more than half of total sales on the website, mustsign a contract[11]that commits them to mandatory arbitration in the event of a dispute.'We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action,' the arbitration clause reads, meaning that no seller can team up with others similarly situated to bring a complaint. Court trials are also waived. At last count, there were2.5 million sellers[12]hawking products on Amazon, making it the largest single employment-related arbitration clause in America. No other company either employs as many people or forces an arbitration relationship on its suppliers or partners. 'The only way you're going to see anything that size is in the digital space,' said Jay Himes, an attorney at Labaton Sucharow. The contract effectively enforces Amazon's private legal space, a maze of rules and regulations placed on third-party sellers that can lead to debilitating suspensions and real hardships. 'There's a fear of retaliation, and the sellers are in competition against themselves,' said Shaoul Sussman, a law student who has gained notoriety for his theories about Amazon's treatment of marketplace sellers. 'It's an abuse of legal loopholes but a profit margin machine.' Amazon's third-party sellers, including both people who stock up at discount store sales and flip the product and true entrepreneurs featuring new products, pay for the privilege of accessing potentially millions of customers.Every seller pays a monthly flat subscription rate, and referral fees for every sale of typically 15 percent, though they can range higher depending on the goods.Sellers also pay to use 'Fulfillment by Amazon' (FBA), where Amazon handles customer service, storage, and shipping through its vast logistics network. Amazon's revenue from these feesgrew to nearly $43 billion in 2018[13], more than one out of every four dollars in third-party sales.The company makesfour times as much profit[14]from marketplace fees as it does from its own retail sales, and that doesn't include revenue from advertising,which manythird-party sellers must invest in[15]to get noticed. But with so many sellers, Amazon has created a marketplace that's simply too big to manage.'People are under attack,' said Chris McCabe, a former Amazon employee who now consults with sellers. 'They get their listings sabotaged.' Third-party sellers can get hurt in amillion different ways[16]:losing control of their listing, having their products purchased and set on fire to claim malfunctioning, seeing their inventory mislabeled as sex toys. Entire websites have formed towrite phony reviews[17], which sellers use to flood rivals with negative reviews, or with badly written five-star raves to draw charges of fakery.Efforts to police reviews or patent infringement led to black-hat sellers filing bogus complaints in a rival's name. 'People will look around the platform, see a product doing well,' said Cynthia Stine, a consultant for third-party sellers based in Dallas, noting another scam. 'They will file a design patent on it, get a patent or trademark. And they get on the platform and kick the brand owner off. That takes some balls.' Amazon is weirdly passive about mediating in these disputes. 'If they're proactive, they create liability,' said James Thomson, who previously worked for Amazon and now advises brands on their Amazon channels. 'The lawyers told us don't check anything, but if someone complains, then check.' What Amazon can do is suspend accounts that violate its terms of service, typically done through curt emails (it's nearly impossible for a seller to talk to a human at Amazon). The announcements are maddeningly nonspecific, only listing broad categories of violation. A single user review expressing mild disapproval can trigger them. If a dog destroys a toy too quickly, or an outfit doesn't fit right, a seller can get suspended. Jeff Schick, an Amazon seller who now counsels others as a lawyer, described his first suspension to me. Someone returned one of his products, a container of dog treats. Amazon handled Jeff's returns, and it has a default setting where it repackages and sends them to other customers. The shipper didn't see the open lid and sent the dog treats off. When the customer received them, they complained that the box was used. Though it was Amazon's fault, Schick got suspended. Under a suspension, Amazon not only deactivates a seller's product listings, but refuses to release funds from prior sales, which could total thousands of dollars. If sellers use FBA, Amazonstill holds the inventory[18]and charges storage fees. Sellers must pay for a removal order to get their products back. With such thin margins in retail, a few weeks off the site could lead to layoffs, bankruptcies, and foreclosures. Consultants told me about sellers crying to them on the phone, trapped and desperate. A seller who feels that Amazon wronged them could appeal to the courts for relief. But by signing the arbitration agreement, sellers are blocked from that venue. Their only real recourse is the 'appeal decision' button at the bottom of the suspension announcement. An entire ecosystem of consultants that help sellers get out of Amazon jail has sprung up; Stine has a 25-person team working on cases. Amazon often goes weeks without responding to appeals. 'This Amazon court system is on par with North Korea in terms of fairness and transparency,' said Paul Rafelson, an attorney who founded the Online Merchants Guild to help sellers band together to protect their interests. I was told that the seller performance team that reads appeals has been outsourced to low-wage countries, where they are expected to read 17 appeals per hour. 'So they have about three minutes,' said Stine. That often leads to what Stine calls 'the punt,' where they write back a vague response like 'we need more information,' even if that information is attached to the appeal. Appeals typically succeed with a kind of forced confession and a plan of action for how the seller will improve its operations in the future. This ruins the opportunity to win an arbitration case down the road if the appeal loses.'If sellers admit to doing something wrong, the chance of success in arbitration is zero,' said consultant C.J. Rosenbaum. If appeals fail, the final escalation is an email to Jeff Bezos, as strange as that sounds. The livelihoods of thousands of independent businesses rely on crafting an email to the richest person in the world. They're at the mercy of an impossible process. Amazon doesn't carry statistics on its commercial arbitration cases, and did not respond to a request for comment for this article. We do know that Amazon has had only 16 consumer arbitration cases over the past five years, with sellers prevailing only twice, according to information from the American Association for Justice, a key advocate for arbitration reform. Theterms of service[19]indicate that they use the American Arbitration Association (AAA) to provide arbiters and venues.Seller boards[20]include talk of arbitration. A lawyer for Amazon sellersposted[21]this letter where the company states,'Amazon is a frequent litigant before AAA.' Indeed, in 2016 Amazon went on the attack,hauling its own third-party sellers[22]into arbitration over fake reviews. Amazon selectively released this information about arbitration, a closed process where the company often chooses its own arbitrator. Julia Duncan of the American Association for Justice wasn't completely aware of how Amazon's marketplace worked before I explained it. 'This is much worse than I thought before getting on the phone with you,' she said. Duncan pointed out that there is no good definition of what third-party sellers are\u2014franchisees, renters of commercial space, or something else\u2014which makes adjudicating their rights difficult. And locking them into arbitration makes it impossible. 'There's no development of the law,' Duncan said. 'There are interesting questions we haven't resolved, with forced arbitration, you're not going to have consistent application of the law.' Amazon may even be able to use the arbitration clause to prevent a plaintiff from bringing an antitrust action against the company, like for selling items below acquisition cost to drive out competitors (so-called 'predatory pricing'). If the plaintiff is a third-party seller on Amazon, the arbitration clause may stop any antitrust cases, providing Amazon immunity. Himes, the litigator, believes that Amazon's power over sellers is near-total. 'They're like little governments in a sense,' he said, 'setting up who can play and what the rules are and what the penalty structures are. And at the end they have the arbitration clause.'  ATTEMPTS TO USEstate courts to get around the arbitration clause have mostly gone aground. A case in Washington state over failure to remit funds to third-party sellersfailed[23]when Amazon triggered arbitration. Amazon may have newfound liability in counterfeit cases, due to aruling last week[24]that said the company is responsible when phony products get to customers, even if it's a third-party seller transaction. But that leaves all the other ways Amazon controls inventory and sales on the website, and the arbitration barrier. California did try to ameliorate some of the problems third-party sellers face with abill proposed in the state legislature[25]. Initially it would have banned Amazon from refusing to disburse third-party seller funds in its possession for more than 90 days without paying 10 percent interest per day. But somehow this language got changed, and now the bill requires Amazon to only 'set out the ground for decisions' to withhold funds. 'Now that bill is practically nothing,' Sussman said. 'Who pressured who?' Amazon wouldn't comment on the matter. Conservative lawmakers have supported arbitration, consistent with their fealty to big business. But here's a case with millions of small businesses being unnecessarily put at risk. That could possibly change some minds, particularly at a time when Big Tech's reputation on Capitol Hill is flagging.'Any other circumstance where there's someone's livelihood on the line, you have at least some due process,' said Julia Duncan. 'Here you have no due process and no application of any rules or standards or whatever.' The federal courts have entrenched arbitration, with multiple rulings allowing its use, including theEpic Systemscase[26]this year. Congress has dithered, and companies are taking advantage. Amazon shows how that manifests in the business world, locking in ever-increasing profits on its marketplace while forcing sellers that have few options for getting their goods noticed online into what can rapidly become a Kafka-esque nightmare.

Authored by Jinia Shawdagor via CoinTelegraph.com,[3] Even though the cryptocurrency industry is not new to ups and downs, 2019 has turned out to be the year with the most surprising reveals. The long-lasting bear market of 2018 moved market analysts to call it the year of regulatory reckoning, leaving many jurisdictions uncertain about how to treat cryptocurrencies.    image courtesy of CoinTelegraph[4]  However, 2019 also turned out to be the year of the comeback, as big tech giants like Facebook moved from banning crypto to embracing it.  Escalating global events such as the trade war between the United States and China have shifted investors' point of view on the utility of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, but there is still a lot to be done even as the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission[5]continues to turn down every other BitcoinETF[6]proposal. </p><p> As the year comes to a close, here is a look at the companies, individuals and various crypto projects that managed to come out on top in 2019, as well as those that failed to mark the year as a positive in their books.  The winners  Bitcoin's double growth  This year, Bitcoin and the entire blockchain and cryptocurrency industry celebrated its tenth anniversary as proof of the resilience of Satoshi Nakamoto's creation. However, at the beginning of 2019, the cryptocurrency industry was just recovering from the so-called crypto winter of 2018.  Fortunately, Bitcoin kicked off the year with a bullish trend that resulted in an approximate price increase of11% higher[7]by the end of the first quarter. Anthony Pompliano, the co-founder of Morgan Creek Digital asset management firm, shared his view with Cointelegraph:  'Bitcoin's price is up significantly in 2019 [as there are] more buyers than sellers on a net basis this year.'  As the trading volume and market capitalization increased throughout the second quarter of the year, Bitcoin led the market with a 165% gain as its price surged from $4,103 to $10,888. Furthermore, Bitcoin's market dominance increased from 54.6% to 65%.  Among the reasons that have promoted Bitcoin's continued growth despite a struggling market is the view that the digital currency can act as a hedge in the wake of increasing global uncertainty. This year, the U.S.-China trade war saw most investors look toBitcoin and gold as hedges[8]. Pompliano also told Cointelegraph that there were other contributing factors:  'The biggest moments probably revolve around the announcement of Libra and the subsequent reactions, both positive and negative, from various folks across the traditional and cryptocurrency markets.'  However, it was not all sunshine for Bitcoin in 2019. Over the third quarter of the year, a bearish outlook emerged as Bitcoin's price decreased significantly as 100 billion in market capitalization was lost. Fortunately, even as the market struggled to gain ground against the bears, Bitcoin not only closed the quarter with the least amount of loss but alsoincreased[9]its market dominance by 5.4%. Ultimately, of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin's performance has been the best so far.    Compared to assets from other markets, Bitcoin's performance throughout the year is still far from tenuous. For instance, even though gold is regarded as a reliable store of value, its price has onlyincreased[10]by 17% since January. Even theS...00 Index[11], although with an excellent performance of +21%, is still dwarfed by Bitcoin's growth throughout the year. Beyond price, Bobby Lee, CEO of the Ballet crypto wallet, told Cointelegraph that Bitcoin has benefited from several major technological developments:  '2019 was a great year for Bitcoin bulls because of the advances in the open-source ecosystem. Lightning Network is increasing Bitcoin's transaction capacity, wallets with built-in, user-friendly features (Wasabi, Samourai) are improving privacy.'  Gods Unchained's rise to popularity  According toreports[12], Gods Unchained, a blockchain-based virtual card game built on Ethereum, emerged as one of the highest-grossing andmost popular blockchain games[13]in 2019. This came about after the platform completelysold out[14]its Genesis Card Pack to the tune of about$6.2 million[15]. This came about after Blizzard, the creators of Hearthstone (a digital trading card game)banned[16]Hearthstone player Chung Ng Wai (also known as Blitzchung) for expressing support for the Hong Kong protests. The Hearthstone game developer also stripped Blitzchung of his winnings.  In addition to the backlash received from the gaming community, Blizzard's actions were criticized in atweet[17]by Gods Unchained that claimed Blizzard 'care[s] about money more than freedom.' Gods Unchained also promised to compensate Blitzchung for his lost winnings while offering him an invitation to their $500,000 tournament.  The tweet by Gods Unchained was retweeted over 10,000 times, and Google searches for the game have since surged. Unlike Hearthstone, Gods Unchained is decentralized and uses blockchain to ensure that players truly own in-game items and have the freedom to trade them at will.  In a move to give online game players long-term incentives, James Ferguson, CEO of Gods Unchained said that the game is 'leveling up the outdated practices of the gaming industry.'  Coinbase's continued expansion  In the past, Coinbase maintained a reputation for employing a rather selective strategy for adding coins to its exchange. As one of the big league exchanges in the crypto space, Coinbase is also known for having significantly fewer large-scale hacks. In a year that saw other major exchanges like Binance fall victim to large scalesecurity breaches[18], leading to the loss of thousands of Bitcoin, Coinbase stands out as a reliable and safe platform.  However, the company was heavily scrutinized by Twitter users this year over itsacquisition[19]of Neutrino, a startup that collects cryptocurrency transactional data using the blockchain. For mostTwitter users[20], this move seems to facilitate the exchange'sspying[21]on its customers.  However, Coinbase's move to acquire Neutrino is, according to a Coinbaseblog post[22], part of its goal to support all assets while complying with applicable laws. In addition to acquiring Neutrino, Coinbase has doubled the number of listed cryptocurrencies on its exchange since 2018. Coinbase's aggressive listing approach has seen theaddition of coins[23]such as Dash, Cosmos and Waves, to mention just a few.  The company has almost constantly been making news throughout the year, from making acquisitions todenying[24]them, as well assecuring[25]multiplepatents[26]along the way. Meanwhile, Coinbases's Visa debit card solution has also seen exponentialgrowth[27]this year, now available for use in even more countries.  In May 2019, the company alsoexpanded[28]its reach to more than 100 countries while making itsUSDC[29]stable coin \u2014 previously only available in the U.S. \u2014 available in 85 of those supported countries. In comparison, Coinbase was only available in about 32 countries last year. Its aggressive expansion appears to be in direct competition to other global players like Binance.  Binance ventures further  Ask any market analyst and they will admit thatinitial exchange offerings[30]have grown into a big business in 2019.Reports[31]have revealed a high demand for IEOs right from Q1 2019 to Q3, not to mention the fact that they collectively raised over $1.5 billion in the first half of 2019 alone. Unlikeinitial coin offerings[32], the biggest determining factor for a successful IEO is the availability of liquidity, and what better way to access liquidity than launching an IEO on a popular exchange.  That is why Binance and its native cryptocurrency BNB have had one of the best years yet. As one of the biggest marketplaces for digital assets, Binance enjoys a significant share of the trading volume. The exchange's performance has been so exceptional that the Binance Coin hasgained value by 150%[33]over the year. When taking everything into account and considering year-on-year growth, Binance Coin has even slightlyoutperformed Bitcoin[34].  Also, Binanceexpanded[35]its reach with the launch of a fully independent U.S. arm of its trading platform. Despite heavy regulatory pressure that keeps the Binance exchange in the U.S. from operating in states such as New York, the company's partnership with BAM, a registered money service in the U.S., has so far given the exchange some leeway.  The losers  Facebook's uncertain Libra launch in 2020  Facebook'sannouncement[36]of its Libra cryptocurrency has been one of the major events of 2019. However, on the unveiling of Libra as a stablecoin backed by a select number of national currencies, U.S. lawmakers reacted with skepticism, summoning Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg to multiple hearings.  At its core, Libra is a stablecoin backed by real money and lets users buy, sell and send money at nearly zero fees across borders. According to the project'swhite paper[37], Libra's overall mission is 'to enable a simple global currency and financial infrastructure that empowers millions of people.'  Libra's white paper further claims that it will use 'a new decentralized blockchain, a low volatility cryptocurrency, and a smart contract platform' to empower about 1.7 billion unbanked people. This will be achieved through the use of Facebook's WhatsApp, Messenger and Calibra, which is a digital wallet designed for Libra users.  Despite Libra's ambitious plan to empower the unbanked, the Libra project has not only come under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers but also faced internal problems of its own. While sharing his thoughts with Cointelegraph, Ballet wallet's Lee expressed optimism about Libra, saying that although 'legislators and regulators in the United States and Europe understand that non-government currencies are a threat to their power, government opposition will diminish over time.' Lee further explained:  'Governments will change their stance because they will come to understand that they can't control or stop Bitcoin, and they will prefer to have their citizens use centralized corporate coins that can easily be regulated, monitored, and pegged to fiat currency.'  Despite Libra's ambitious plan to empower the unbaked, the Libra project has not only come under heavy scrutiny from lawmakers but also faced internal problems of its own.  TheU.S. Congress[38]has asked Facebook topause[39]further development of the Libra projects, and cynics now believe that the project will not get out of the starting blocks without the government's approval. Multiple European countries have alsospoken out[40]against the proposed cryptocurrency, while Chinaannounced[41]that it will soon launch its own stablecoin, a nationalcentral bank digital currency[42], likely as a retaliatory measure. Furthermore, in the wake of increased scrutiny from government regulators, some of Libra's high profile backers like Visa, eBay, MasterCard and PayPal haveabandoned[43]the project.  A rocky year for Circle  In October 2018,Circle[44], a cryptocurrency firm based in Boston and backed by Goldman Sachsteamed up[45]with Coinbase to launch the Centre consortium. Counting on its reputation as one of the most well-funded crypto startups, the two companies aimed to help accelerate adoption of cryptocurrencies. Through the Centre consortium, Coinbase and Circle would increase liquidity to the crypto industry through the issue of a stable coin called the USD Coin.  InJuly this year[46], Coinbase and Circle broadened participation into their consortium in a move that will allow other financial entities interested in the project to issue the USD Coin. In theannouncement[47], the Centre network mentioned that 'a natural next step is to imagine a new global digital currency' that would include a basket of tokens backed by a variety of stablecoins. Simply put, Centre's plan is to go with a Facebook-like approach to create a global currency.  However, Circle has had a rocky experience throughout 2019. Even though the USD Coin has received a positive reception, with Centreclaiming[48]that the stablecoin has been used to clear on-chain transfers worth over $11 billion, Circleclosed[49]its mobile app, reduced its fundraising goal by 40%, and laid off 10% of its staff between May and June this year. Just recently, the companylet go[50]of 10 more of its employees, citing efforts to streamline its services.  The latest news of layoffs from Circle comes after the recenttransition[51]of the company's co-founder Sean Neville from his position as CEO to a seat at the company's board of directors. However, a representative of Circle has denied any connections between the recent layoffs and Sean's transition, telling Cointelegraph that:  'None of this is related to Sean transitioning out of the co-CEO role. Sean will continue to serve on Circle's board.'  Craig Wright's court battles  When Australian-born technologistCraig Wright[52]claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto back in 2015, most people in the crypto community were skeptical and thought nothing of it.  Most people expected that the Satoshi Nakamoto impersonator would have scurried back into obscurity by now. However, Wright and his claims have continued to headline the news throughout 2019. Wrightclaims[53]that he invented Bitcoin a decade ago and mined over 1 million BTC along with his late business partner Dave Kleiman. After Kleiman's death in 2013, Wright claims that he put the mined Bitcoin in the 'Tulip Trust.'  However, the Australian entrepreneur and computer scientist was sued by Kleiman's estate in 2018 for allegedly stealing up to 1 million Bitcoin. In the past, it is said that Wright and Kleiman worked together on mining and developing Bitcoin. According to Kleiman's family, Wright stole between 550,000 to 1 million Bitcoin \u2014 worth about $10 billion.  The ongoing case led to Magistrate Judge Bruce's ruling thatordered[54]Wright to turn over half of his Bitcoin holdings and intellectual property from before 2014 to Kleiman's estate, presuming he is indeed Nakamoto. On Oct. 31, the trialsre-emerged[55]after Wright pulled out of the settlement agreement to forfeit half his Bitcoin and intellectual property.  In addition to his court battles, Wright was scrutinized by the crypto community afterpresenting[56]what was considered forged documents as evidence of him being Nakamoto in another case of Wright against Peter McCormack. Wright's case against McCormack is based on the fact that McCormack's repeated statement that Wright is not Satoshi is harmful to Wright's reputation. Most recently, Wrightpresented[57]another document that allegedly proves how he came up with the Satoshi Nakamoto pseudonym.  Bitcoin ETF's continual rejection by the SEC  Even though U.S. regulators have always left a window for the possibility of approving Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in the future, up until now, every single attempt to license a Bitcoin ETF has been met with failure. In October this year, an ETF proposal filed by Bitwise Asset Management in conjunction with NYSE Arca wasrejected[58]by the Securities and Exchange Commission for failing to meet legal requirements that prevent illicit market manipulation.  In fact, all Bitcoin ETF proposals presented to the SEC have been rejected on concerns about fraudulent activities and market manipulation. One of the main criteria for approving an ETF is establishing the underlying market of a new commodity-based ETF.  If the underlying market is resistant to manipulation, regulators can give the ETF the go-ahead. Given the complexities of the Bitcoin market, it seems approval from the SEC is unlikely. Despite the earlier rejection of Bitwise's application, the SEC laterannounced[59]that it would review Bitwise's proposal once again.  While speaking to Cointelegraph on the realistic timeline of the first Bitcoin ETF approval, Charles Lu, the CEO of the Findora fintech toolkit provider said, 'For a Bitcoin ETF proposal to gain SEC approval, the sponsor will need to prove that real price discovery is happening as opposed to market manipulations.' In Lu's opinion, this will not happen anywhere soon, since the SEC would require 'surveillance sharing agreements' with the big exchanges.  2019 and 2020  Overall, the crypto industry has shown some significant growth over the past year. Although volatile, Bitcoin is showing significant signs of growth. More institutional investors are looking into the industry to find more ways to invest as well. Even though there is a downtrend in market cap and trading volumes, prominent tradersbelieve[60]that a turn of fate might just be around the corner, especially for Bitcoin holders.  Out of all the winners and losers of 2019, perhaps Facebook Libra is one that stands to be most impactful in 2020. For most onlookers, it will be interesting to see whether Facebook's Libra project will turn a new leaf and launch successfully in 2020. If it does, there is a high likelihood that big changes will take place throughout the entire industry.

Why? Monsanto alone owns the key genetic traits to more than 90 percent of the soybeans planted by farmers in the United States, and 80 percent of the corn. Which means Monsanto can charge farmers much higher prices. </p><p>Farmers are getting squeezed from the other side, too, because the food processors they sell their produce to are also consolidating into mega companies that have so much market power they can cut the prices they pay to farmers. This doesn't mean lower food prices to you. It means more profits to the monopolists. Monopolies All Around America used to have antitrust laws that stopped corporations from monopolizing markets, and often broke up the biggest culprits. No longer. It's a hidden upward redistribution of money and power from the majority of Americans to corporate executives and wealthy shareholders. You may think you have lots of choices, but take a closer look: 1. The four largest food companies control 82 percent of beef packing, 85 percent of soybean processing, 63 percent of pork packing, and 53 percent of chicken processing. 2. There are many brands of toothpaste, but 70 percent of all of it comes from just two companies. 3. You may think you have your choice of sunglasses, but they're almost all fromone company: Luxottica - which also owns nearly all the eyeglass retail outlets. 4. Practically every plastic hanger in America is now made by one company, Mainetti. 5. What brand of cat food should you buy? Looks like lots of brands but behind them are basically just two companies. 6. What about your pharmaceuticals? Yes, you can get low-cost generic versions. But drug companies are in effect paying the makers of generic drugs to delay cheaper versions. Such 'pay for delay' agreements are illegal in other advanced economies, but antitrust enforcement hasn't laid a finger on them in America. They cost you and me an estimated $3.5 billion a year. 7. You think your health insurance will cover the costs? Health insurers are consolidating, too. Which is one reason your health insurance premiums, copayments, and deductibles are soaring. 8. You think you have a lot of options for booking discount airline tickets and hotels online? Think again. You have only two. Expedia merged with Orbitz, so that's one company. And then there's Priceline. 9. How about your cable and Internet service? Basically just four companies (and two of them just announced they're going to merge). Why the Monopolization of America is a Huge Problem The problem with all this consolidation into a handful of giant firms is they don't have to compete. Which means they can - and do - jack up your prices. Such consolidation keeps down wages. Workers with less choice of whom to work for have a harder time getting a raise. When local labor markets are dominated by one major big box retailer, or one grocery chain, for example, those firms essentially set wage rates for the area. These massive corporations also have a lot of political clout. That's one reason they're consolidating: Power. Antitrust laws were supposed to stop what's been going on. But today, they're almost a dead letter. This hurts you. We've Forgotten History The first antitrust law came in 1890 when Senator John Sherman responded to public anger about the economic and political power of the huge railroad, steel, telegraph, and oil cartels - then called 'trusts' - that were essentially running America. A handful of corporate chieftains known as 'robber barons' presided over all this - collecting great riches at the expense of workers who toiled long hours often in dangerous conditions for little pay. Corporations gouged consumers and corrupted politics. Then in 1901, progressive reformer Teddy Roosevelt became president. By this time, the American public was demanding action. In his first message to Congress in December 1901, only two months after assuming the presidency, Roosevelt warned, 'There is a widespread conviction in the minds of the American people that the great corporations known as the trusts are in certain of their features and tendencies hurtful to the general welfare.' Roosevelt used the Sherman Antitrust Act to go after the Northern Securities Company, a giant railroad trust run by J. P. Morgan, the nation's most powerful businessman. The U.S. Supreme Court backed Roosevelt and ordered the company dismantled. In 1911, John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil Trust was broken up, too. But in its decision, the Supreme Court effectively altered the Sherman Act, saying that monopolistic restraints of trade were objectionable if they were 'unreasonable' - and that determination was to be made by the courts. What was an unreasonable restraint of trade? In the presidential election of 1912, Roosevelt, running again for president but this time as a third party candidate, said he would allow some concentration of industries where there were economic efficiencies due to large scale. He'd then he'd have experts regulate these large corporations for the public benefit. Woodrow Wilson, who ended up winning the election, and his adviser Louis Brandeis, took a different view. They didn't think regulation would work, and thought all monopolies should be broken up. For the next 65 years, both views dominated. We had strong antitrust enforcement along with regulations that held big corporations in check. Most big mergers were prohibited. Even large size was thought to be a problem. In 1945, in the case ofUnited States v. Alcoa(1945), the Supreme Court ruled that even though Alcoa hadn't pursued a monopoly, it had become one by becoming so large that it was guilty of violating the Sherman Act. What Happened to Antitrust? All this changed in the 1980s, after Robert Bork - who, incidentally, I studied antitrust law with at Yale Law School, and then worked for when he became Solicitor General under President Ford - wrote an influential book calledThe Antitrust Paradox,which argued that the sole purpose of the Sherman Act is consumer welfare. Bork argued that mergers and large size almost always create efficiencies that bring down prices, and therefore should be legal. Bork's ideas were consistent with the conservative Chicago School of Economics, and found a ready audience in the Reagan White House. Bork was wrong. But since then, even under Democratic administrations, antitrust has all but disappeared. The Monopolization of High Tech We're seeing declining competition even in cutting-edge, high-tech industries. In the new economy, information and ideas are the most valuable forms of property. This is where the money is. We haven't seen concentration on this scale ever before. Google and Facebook are now the first stops for many Americans seeking news. Meanwhile, Amazon is now the first stop for more than a half of American consumers seeking to buy anything. Talk about power. Contrary to the conventional view of an American economy bubbling with innovative small companies, the reality is quite different. The rate at which new businesses have formed in the United States has slowed markedly since the late 1970s. Big Tech's sweeping patents, standard platforms, fleets of lawyers to litigate against potential rivals, and armies of lobbyists have created formidable barriers to new entrants. Google's search engine is so dominant, 'Google' has become a verb. The European Union filed formal antitrust charges against Google, accusing it of forcing search engine users into its own shopping platforms. And last June, it fined Google a record $2.7 billion. But not in America. It's Time to Revive Antitrust Economic and political power cannot be separated because dominant corporations gain political influence over how markets are organized, maintained, and enforced - which enlarges their economic power further. One of the original goals of the antitrust laws was to prevent this. Big Tech \u2014 along with the drug, insurance, agriculture, and financial giants \u2014 is coming to dominate both our economy and our politics. There's only one answer:It is time to revive antitrust. The post The Biggest Economic Problem You're Hearing Almost Nothing About[1] appeared first on EgbertoWillies.com[2].

Here are the eight biggest losers if it fails:<br/>Facebook<br/><br/><br/>Big tech companies -- including members of Mark Zuckerberg's group FWD.us -- have been advocating fiercely for comprehensive reform, largely to increase the number of foreign high-tech workers allowed in the country at any time. They successfully lobbied to nearly triple the number of high-skilled H-1B visas in Senate-passed legislation (from 65,000 up to 180,000), and beat back some of the stricter enforcement proposals on offer, including an effort to require employers to prove immigrant employees didn't displace U.S. workers.<br/><br/>Peach Lovers<br/><br/><br/>Immigration reform would create new regulations allowing low-skilled immigrants and agriculture workers of all kinds to work in the country legally. But it could have the biggest impact on labor-intensive crops like tomatoes and peaches. If immigration reform stems or reverses the drying labor supply -- a big if -- it would alleviate the pressure on farmers[1] to swap out delicious fruits for less work-intensive crops.<br/><br/>Granny (and future grannies)<br/><br/><br/>One of the less-discussed aspects of immigration reform is the extent to which it would help re-established the demographic pyramid. Because most immigrants are younger, and would suddenly be subject to payroll taxes, the Social Security actuary expects immigration reform will reduce the long-run Social Security trust fund shortfall. <br/><br/><person><nameText>Marco Rubio</nameText></person><br/><br/><br/>The conservative backlash against immigration reform is already causing its Republican champion, <person><nameText>Sen. Marco Rubio </nameText></person>(R-FL), to overcompensate by lurching right on just about every other issue. If the reform effort succeeds, he'll at the very least have something big to show for his brief Senate tenure -- including a strict border security regime -- if he decides to run for president. He'll also attract a huge donor network. But if the process lapses, he'll be the guy who shook hands with Democrats to provide amnesty for illegal immigrants, against the wishes of the GOP base, and got nothing for it.<br/><br/>Gary Miller<br/><br/><br/>Redistricting has inoculated nearly all House Republicans from the repercussions of killing immigration reform. Indeed, most GOP districts with large Hispanic populations still went overwhelmingly for <person><nameText>Mitt Romney[</nameText></person>2]. Rep. Gary Miller (R-CA) is one major exception. Redistricting landed him in a district that voted overwhelmingly for President Obama. And unlike other purple-district Republicans, such as Mario Diaz-Balart (R-FL), Miller and a handful of others also won't be able to claim to have pushed for reform as hard as possible.<br/><br/>The Macroeconomy<br/><br/><br/>For a political system forever at odds over fiscal and economic policy, and an economy stuck in the doldrums as a result, immigration reform is a freebie. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the Senate immigration bill would increase real GDP by 3.3 percent in 2023 relative to the current baseline. Growing the economic pie means revenues rise and deficits fall without raising taxes. <br/><br/><person><nameText>Paul Ryan</nameText></person><br/><br/><br/><person><nameText>Paul Ryan </nameText></person>has more freedom in the GOP conference than any members of the traditional leadership structure, from the Speaker on down. He's also one of the only party leaders who's actively lobbying conference members to support comprehensive reform. If they rebuff him it will be a defeat surpassed only by his losing vice presidential candidacy in 2012.<br/><br/>Undocumented Immigrants<br/><br/><br/>This should go without saying, but without comprehensive immigration reform, 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally, including those with children who are citizens, will be denied a path to citizenship themselves and continue to face deportation.<br/> [1]: <url normalizedValue=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/02/business/la-fi-immigration-farm-labor-20130202\">http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/02/business/la-fi-immigration-farm-labor-20130202</url> [2]:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://cookpolitical.com/story/5842\">http://cookpolitical.com/story/5842</url></p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-TAPM11602813748548520205641500</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TAPM-116028</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:590B-D3W1-F03R-N3XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"727\"/><timeReceived>4:07 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Talking Points Memo</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>July 26, 2013 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The amount of power and capital concentrated in Silicon Valley has skyrocketed over the past ten years, as has the frequency of reported abuses of power. Tech giants including Facebook, Apple, and Google had to address incidents that rocked public trust in their companies. Today, people are perhaps more skeptical of big tech than ever before. </p><p>Visit Business Insider's homepage for more stories.[1] As the tech and information industries boomed in the 2010s, the decade was also rocked by scandals across both industries. Tech companies are increasingly at the center of political and social issues in the US and across the globe, and the past 10 years saw a wave of abuses of power, failed business ventures, and disastrous gadget rollouts. Facebook, Apple, and Google \u2014 some of the most powerful tech companies in existence \u2014 were the most frequent sites of scandal. However, startups and fringe organizations saw their share of infamy over the past ten years as well. And then there were the NSA spying revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden. Here are the biggest tech scandals from 2010 to the present. 2010: Over a dozen workers commit suicide after working under brutal conditions at a Chinese factory making iPhones, iPads, and HP computers Reuters/Bobby Yip/FilesAt least 14 workers at Foxconn factories in Shenzen, China died by suicide over the course of 2010. Foxconn, which manufactures gadgets for clients including Apple, Nintendo, and HP, reportedly expected workers to put in extreme overtime shifts under dismal working conditions and with cruel management who would dock workers' pay for minor infractions, according to the Wall Street Journal[2]. The company reportedly installed safety nets to catch workers who jumped from upper stories and asked workers to sign a contract agreeing not to kill themselves. Apple, HP, and other Foxconn clients said they would pressure Foxconn to improve its working conditions in the wake of the suicides. China also put new laws[3] in place in 2012 limiting workers' overtime hours.2013: Edward Snowden releases confidential documents showing the NSA has secretly had access to Google and Yahoo servers ReutersIn one of the most famous whistleblower complaints in US history, former contractor Edward Snowden revealed[4] that the National Security Agency had been spying on people's Google and Yahoo accounts, retaining text, audio, and video at will without users' knowledge. Both Google and Yahoo expressed surprise at the findings, stating that they had not granted the government access to their servers. However, Google said in a statement[5] that the company had \"long been concerned about the possibility of this kind of snooping.\" Snowden still faces charges of violating the Espionage Act \u2014 he is living in Moscow, where he has been granted asylum status.2015: Volkswagen admits to cheating on emissions tests to make its cars seem more eco-friendly than they are Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesThe Environmental Protection Agency discovered that Volkswagen was using \"defeat devices\" on its cars that detected when they were being tested for emissions and delivered artificial results to make them seem more environmentally friendly. Volkswagen confirmed[6] the allegation, saying that 11 million of its cars were fitted with defeat devices. The German car maker agreed[7] to pay $4.3 billion in fines to the US and spend more than $22 billion to address claims from regulators and car owners. Six Volkswagen executives faced criminal charges for their alleged involvement in the scheme.See the rest of the story at Business Insider[8] See Also: 12 products and features hyped up by Apple that

And welcome to a special edition of News Stream where we look back on some of the year's bigest technology stories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A high profile breach sees private celebrity photos posted online. Just how safe is your data?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We test out the latest drone from an industry leader, DJI's Inspire One.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And Apple retires a design icon. We pay tribute to the iPod Classic.</p><p>Now one of the big themes this year in technology: how safe is your data? Now we're putting more and more of our personal information online and this year has seen a string of massive breaches. AT&amp;T and eBay were just some of the company's compromised.</p><p>eBay alone says hackers may have stolen personal records from more than 100 million users. But the highest profile incident involved celebrities. Now several Hollywood stars saw their private photos posted publicly on the internet after hackers gained access to their iCloud accounts.</p><p>Now all of those security breaches have put the focus on online privacy and how much personal information we're sharing.</p><p>Now data expert Adam Tanner recently wrote a book called \"What Stays in Vegas: The World of Personal Data.\" And I asked him about the ways we might be revealing too much about ourselves online.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ADAM TANNER, AUTHOR: I'm just surprised by the breadth of different data gathers that there are. And so for example one of the most surprising is Jimmy Page, the former Led Zeppelin guitarist, JimmyPage.com where you go to that site. Just to get into the site you have to share the personal information, your name, first name, your birth date, your gender and so on. That's just to use the site. And many sites are requiring this kind of information. That's much more extensive than you would have expected in past.</p><p>LU STOUT: But why would Jimmy Page want that information about us?</p><p>TANNER: I've met him and I still do not know, but again a lot of these services are great. And if he can personalize it and make you happy as a customer they may be something that you appreciate as a fan.</p><p>But there should be choice and transparency, you should know what you're getting into and what you're getting in exchange. And often we don't have that level of transparency that I would like to see.</p><p>LU STOUT: This is my Google search history. There are a couple of embarrassing Tidbits that I found in there. But you know I can't live or work off the grid. So what can I do to better protect my personal data?</p><p>TANNER: Well, so you have to decide what's important to you. Are there things you don't want widely shared.</p><p>Now you've showed some of these things over here that could be sensitive in some countries or some circumstances, but not in others.</p><p>So in the appendix of my book, I give some examples of how you could mask some of the activities that you do on the internet, you could use different email addresses for different companies via easy services. You could, for example, encrypt things. These are all ways to boost your privacy if that's something you care about.</p><p>And there are certain commercial website out there that do, in fact, respect our privacy and online data. Of all places, Wal-Mart's contact lenses website.</p><p>TANNER: That's right. So if you're buying contact lenses it's not incredibly personal, but I mean how well you see is somewhat personal. And they tell you, look, we're not going to sell the data to any other site if you buy your contact lenses from us.</p><p>And I think this is a fairly good example of some transparency. You want to know what's happening with my data if I share this bit of information, because if I know how well you see and if I know your waist size and if I know from the buying of the pants and something else, this could be an intimate portrait and this is what happens. There's lots of different information is piled onto itself for commercial gatherers.</p><p>LU STOUT: Now in addition to the online world, you've also been researching data collection in the real world, namely in casinos like in Las Vegas. What's happening here?</p><p>TANNER: So, in Las Vegas many of these casinos have the same product at the core, it's the same machines, the same different kinds of gambling opportunity in different packages. So they want to have you loyal to them. And they do that through the loyalty program. If you decide to join, you may get free food, free benefits of different kinds, drinks and spa treatments and chips and so on.</p><p>So they want you to join. You have to give your personal information. They'll know an incredible amount of what you do inside the space of the casino. and in exchange for that information they will give you those perks.</p><p>Now they don't sell the information beyond the casinos. And that's actually what stays in Vegas. Unlike a lot of the information that you share on the internet, which may be then shared beyond with other companies.</p><p>So that's why I think it's interesting to see what companies are doing with the data and who is being transparent about what goes on beyond.</p><p>LU STOUT: It's incredible and very worrying, isn't it, that in this era of mass data collection the cliche is true. There was no such thing as a free lunch. It applies in certain casinos in the real world, it applies to Facebook where they're collecting our personal data for this free service. And this is something that we need to remind ourselves of.</p><p>TANNER: Well, of course.</p><p>So countless millions use Facebook and love it, but they do use your data to target information to you very -- and advertising very directly.</p><p>Now what you keep in mind that sometimes having even social networks can lead to inferences about you that you did not expect to be known.</p><p>So, for example, who your friends are could reflect on details about you that you had not shared.</p><p>So, studies have shown, for example, if you don't declare a sexual preference, who your friends are could indicate that you're gay based on the percentage of people -- or who your likes are could suggest a similar kind of thing.</p><p>Now these are things you may not have expected, but are possible through the big world of big data.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: As Adam Tanner suggests, encryption is one good way to safeguard your personal data, but for a full proof approach, just don't make any sensitive purchases online. He recommends you go to the store and pay in cash.</p><p>So, how do people gain access to the private photos of celebrities? Well, Apple says that their accounts were compromised in a targeted attack on user names and passwords, but did not result from any breach in Apple systems.</p><p>Still, some have now questioned the wisdom of storing data in the cloud. It's safe to say that many don't really understand the cloud.</p><p>Well, the Cameron Diaz movie is called Sex Tape is based around the idea that nobody understands how data syncs with the cloud.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CAMERON DIAZ, ACTRESS: What if it gets out on the Internet?</p><p>We have to get that back right now.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was using that.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It went up. It went up to the cloud.</p><p>DIAZ: You can't get it down from the cloud?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Nobody understands the cloud. It's a mystery.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: Now, it's not a mystery, it's actually fairly simple. You can think of cloud computing as being like outsourcing. Now, instead of storing data on your iPad or computer, its stored in a server on the internet. In a sense, storing photos in the cloud it's a little bit like putting money in a bank. You're putting your property in this dedicated storage space. It means you don't have to keep all your money at home, or keep all your photos on your iPad.</p><p>But when you do want to see your photos, the cloud allows you to access it on any device, similar to how banks allow you to withdraw money from any ATM.</p><p>And it's not a new idea, in 1996, Hotmail became one of the first ever webmail companies, an early example of moving data to the cloud that still exists today in the form of Outlook, Gmail, or Yahoo Mail.</p><p>Now still ahead right here on this special edition of News Stream, we test fly the latest drone from DJI, the company behind the Phantom.</p><p>LU STOUT: You may have never heard of DJI, but you know their drones. The Shenzhen-vased company has created flying machines so iconic, even Cartman from South Park has flown them.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It can fly like a quarter mile away from whoever is controlling it. And it can take video of the entire town right to your phone. Don't touch the propellers.</p><p>LU STOUT: After its success of its Phantom drones, the firm has launched a new, more upscale model. With the Inspire 1, DJI is out to further expand its market for commercial drones. I talked to DJI's Michael Perry about the new drone.</p><p>MICHAEL PERRY, DJI: It's like a marriage between form and function. So on the one hand, it does look very cool, but on the other hand, the small chassis in the middle is aerodynamic and it's also lightweight so that it can carry all this complex technology in a really efficient way.</p><p>It's also got this motor servo inside that folds the wings up. So while it's in the air, the camera can rotate 360 degrees without getting any other parts of the machine in the way.</p><p>LU STOUT: Who is the target market for the Inspire 1 drone?</p><p>PERRY: So, the Inspire 1 actually bridges our two main sort of platform series. So with the Phantom, we had a very easy to use platform, so it's just ready to go out of the box. with our more professional series you were able to get the high quality imaging, but you need a lot more experience to get it set up and get it in the air.</p><p>This combines the ease of use with a lot of the professional features of our larger system.</p><p>LU STOUT: So this is a so-called pro-sumer (ph) drone. How much does it cost?</p><p>PERRY: So, the final pricing has not been released yet, but we're looking around $3,000.</p><p>LU STOUT: OK, so for around $3,000, whether you are a professional or a consumer hobbyist you could use it right out of the box.</p><p>But a lot of policymakers around the world aren't catching up. In fact, the reason why we have to fly this in our news room is because we have to wait for weeks here in Hong Kong just to get the government OK to be able to fly it outside.</p><p>Are you talking to policymakers around the world about rules and regulations for flying drones like this?</p><p>PERRY: Absolutely. And it's a big challenge, because everybody wants the same thing, which is opening the skies to innovation while also keeping them safe. So it's a big challenge on the behalf of regulators.</p><p>At the same time, we are seeing a lot of really positive movements towards creating an integrated air environment. In Australia and New Zealand, for instance, they've set out some very clear rules of the road. So do this, don't do that. If you do something that's against the rules, then you get fined.</p><p>We're hoping to see more clear regulations from all of our different partners around the world.</p><p>LU STOUT: There's the issue of free flying, issue of safe flying practices and also the issue of privacy. And recently it was another DJI drone that was used to fly and go into Apple headquarters top secret, the new building that's being built in Cupertino. What is DJI's stance on privacy and the use of commercial drones?</p><p>PERRY: So these systems were clearing designed for creativity. So allowing people to get a new perspective on the world. So, that's kind of the thought process behind every new imaging technology, whether it's Google Glass, telephoto lenses or instant film. When you have that sort of new innovation in technology and imaging there is the concern about privacy.</p><p>But there's a combination of the regulatory side in terms of what air space it belongs to who. And then also a matter of social etiquette. What are the situations that are proper and improper to use that? We see that already developing with these systems.</p><p>LU STOUT: I find it remarkable that the maker of these drones, DJI, it's a Shenzhen-based company. But it's not widely recognized as a Chinese brand like Lenovo or Huawei or Xiaomi. How were you able to brand DJI without branding itself as a Chinese drone maker, or a Chinese tech firm?</p><p>PERRY: Well, we don't necessarily think of ourselves as a Chinese company. We think of ourselves as an international company. We have offices in the U.S., Japan, Germany, all over the place. And I think that really reflects our team, which is from all over the world and also approach into the market which is to develop first abroad and then also domestically.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Michael Perry there of DJI.</p><p>Now from the cutting edge of technology to a more simple form that's all around us: the bright lights of Hong Kong harbor are a popular tourist site. And its neon-lit streets are an iconic part of the city.</p><p>But one day those neon signs may become a thing of the past. I met one man determined to preserve the signs and with them a key part of Hong Kong history.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Layers and layers of neon signs from restaurants, banks, boutiques, all competing for attention on the streets of Hong Kong. They have defined Hong Kong's cityscape for decades, emitting an intoxicating glow that has inspired artists and filmmakers the world over, including Ridley Scott and his vision of a neon lit dystopia in Blade Runner.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Neon signs have a very unique quality of light, but they also have incredible associations. I mean, they really mirror the way cities have developed throughout the 20th Century and the associations with them have changed from sort of glam and glitz to kind of seediness and the risque to (inaudible) prosperity as was the case in Hong Kong.</p><p>LU STOUT: Right above me is the iconic neon sign for Sammy's Kitchen, a local restaurant that dates back to the 1960s. It was sketched by its owner Sammy Yip (ph). But this little bit of Hong Kong history has a shelf life. It'll be taken down in a matter of months.</p><p>They are being taken down for a variety of reasons -- not passing code and not being cost effective or as energy efficient as LED signs. Hong Kong's Neon glow is fading.</p><p>We go into the studio of one of the city's remaining neon artists. Lau Wan started his craft when he was just 12-years-old.</p><p>LAU WAN, NEON CRAFTSMAN (through translator): During the boom seven or eight of us worked here together. Now, business is not so good. Many craftsman are getting older, some have gone away. So there's just me left.</p><p>LU STOUT: Master Lau shows us the painstaking process of creating a sign, heating and bending the glass and adding the correct color and chemical elements to set them aglow.</p><p>WAN: I'm not young anymore. I've stayed in this industry until now. My kids have grown up. I'm just here to pass the days. There's no hope.</p><p>What hope?</p><p>LU STOUT: It's a matter of time before these street scenes change. But Aric Chen is out to preserve and commemorate the city's glowing neon landmarks online with the neonsigns.hk virtual gallery space and eventually in the real world when the M+ museum opens its doors in 2017.</p><p>Until then, he admires the craft and typography of the signs that still hang above him.</p><p>ARIC CHEN, DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE CURATOR, M+: You know, it's funny we always appreciate things more as we realize they're disappearing.</p><p>LEDs definitely have their advantages, but I think what we lose when we lose neon signs is a very sort of special quality, like a more sort of analogue quality of light, let's say. And also a craft, because there is a really beautiful craft to making neon signs. It's sort of like a difference between a digital recording and a vinyl record and there's room for both.</p><p>LU STOUT: On the streets of Hong Kong, neon may be flickering out, but in Hong Kong's archives, they have risen in status to works of art.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: Apple had a big year, but it also said farewell to an iconic product in 2014. Now still ahead on this special edition of News Stream, we pay tribute to the iPod classic.</p><p>LU STOUT: Welcome back.</p><p>Now 30 years ago, Apple introduced the original Machintosh. It was revolutionary, because it had a graphical user interface. No more typing obscure commands with the keyboard.</p><p>Now the Macintosh was the first to make the mouse an essential part of computing.</p><p>Now earlier this year, I spoke to Susan Kare, the designer of the Mac's icons. And I asked her what it was like to work on that team.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SUSAN KARE, ICON DESIGNER: I had a wonderful experience working on that Mac team. At any time of the day or night, someone might pop in to demo something new or Phil Atkinson, who wrote Mac Paint would arrive to demo a new Mac Paint feature to the rest of the group. It was seeing things like drawing a circle with a mouse and filling it with a pattern and changing font sizes from a menu, it -- it's so no big deal now, but it was pretty cool to see those features come to life.</p><p>LU STOUT: And what was it like working with Steve Jobs?</p><p>KARE: Well, I loved working with Steve Jobs, because he cared so much about detail. And a lot of what I did involved symbols and graphics and he could be a bit relentless in trying to get something just right, but in retrospect I'm really grateful for that exposure to obsession with detail, because I've -- you know, tried to think about that ever since.</p><p>I mean, I learned -- if you were going to show Steve something -- and he would always drop by and he loved seeing what was new in graphics, I learned never to show him something and say do you like this? Because he would invariably say no, because he wanted to get you to work on it more and maybe come up with something better, even if he did like it.</p><p>So, the work around was to just show him a few things and say which of these do you like.</p><p>LU STOUT: Let's talk more about the technical constraints and the creative constraints working with the original Macintosh operating system. I mean, it's low resolution. It's black and white. Were you as a designer ever frustrated with the constraints, or did you feel that you could actually be more creative because of what you were up against?</p><p>KARE: Well, you know, looking back on it now it seems as if it was limited, but at the time I thought it was wonderful.</p><p>I always thought of everything as a little puzzle. And there's still a huge amount of different things you can do even in a space that -- 32 by 32 is still 1,000 dots.</p><p>LU STOUT: And your classic icons, they are simple. They are meaningful. And they're also friendly and approachable. I mean, even the icon of the bomb that you designed, it still has this sort of friendly cartoonish aspect to it.</p><p>Do you think that approachability in design has kind of been lost today?</p><p>KARE: Well, I mean, I would never want to overgeneralize, because you know yes, sometimes no. But I do think that when icons are in the style where there's a tremendous amount of detail that makes something look very specific, say thinking about a smiling face looks like everybody. But if you have hair and a beard and a mustache, it can start to look like one specific person.</p><p>LU STOUT: When you were working with the original Mac team, did you ever feel at odds with the software designers or the engineers or the so- called techies? Or were you well integrated in the team?</p><p>KARE: They were great. It was one of the most good-humored, creative, hard--working batch of people I had ever worked with. And I remember Steve used to say we're going to look back on these days and these are going to be some of the best days of our lives. And he was right.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LU STOUT: That was designer Susan Kare.</p><p>Now we go from an Apple anniversary to an Apple eulogy, because in 2014 Apple discontinued the iPod Classic. It was the latest incarnation of Apple's first consumer electronics device, the gadget that sent it on a path to becoming the world's most valuable company.</p><p>It all started with Steve Jobs' passion for music and his declaration that digital music players, quote, \"truly sucked.\"</p><p>It's worth remembering what music players looked like before the iPod.</p><p>Now the Creative Nomad was the size of a chunky CD player with a tiny screen. So Jobs pushed his team to come up with their own device.</p><p>It wasn't until 2001 when Toshiba told then Apple executive John Rubenstein that it had a tiny new hard drive, but Toshiba had no idea what to do with it. Rubenstein new the hard drive would be perfect for Apple's music player. And just nine months later, Jobs unveiled the iPod.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>STEVE JOBS, CO-FOUNDER, CEO, APPLE COMPUTER: And there it is right there. This amazing little device holds 1,000 songs and it goes right in my pocket.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>LU STOUT: But the iPod wasn't an immediate hit. The tech site Slashdot famously dismissed the device with this withering summary, quote, \"no wireless, less space than its competitor the Nomad, lame.\"</p><p>Now that is all for this special look back on the big tech stories of 2014. Now what's next, you can find out by watching News Stream in 2015.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNNI-2014122601cbk31</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNNI2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5DXN-K0S1-JB20-G2T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">246052</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3480\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Cable News Network All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>CNN INTERNATIONAL</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>December 26, 2014 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>SHOW</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Apple Computer</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>DJI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Aviation</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000350</classCode><className>COMPUTER CRIME</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUZBMUY1NEJCRTYyNEU2NDgwMzk4QzhBOTBEMTk1MDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REE3RUI5RUNDMTgyNDU3Rjk2QUMwOTVBOUI1NDNFOTY</classCode><className>Computer Crimes</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008ZGX</classCode><className>CYBERCRIME</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000963</classCode><className>INTERNET PRIVACY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DFHJ</classCode><className>PHOTO &amp;

But this time may be different as the tech sector faces several risks that could send their shares crashing worse than 2018's pullback[1] from highs that many individual tech stocks have not fully recovered from. Those risks include an earnings plunge on the back of an economic slowdown, continuing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and regulation and breakup of big tech firms.From Nvidia Corp.</p><p>(NVDA[2]), Intel Corp. (INTC[3]) and Apple Inc. (AAPL[4]) to Facebook Inc. (FB[5]), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG[6]) and Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN[7]), tech stocks will face major hurdles over the next year. 'This is a deep cyclical sector that people mistake for growth,' Richard Bernstein, founder and chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told the Financial Times[8].Tech Stocks are Leading Again\u2014But for How Long? Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund: +20% S...00: +13% Source: CNN Money, YTD performance as of 10:30 AM EST 03/22. What it Means for Investors Tech companies tend to be more vulnerable to period of poor earnings growth, Bernstein explained. Recent data from Goldman Sachs showed the consensus bottom-up[9] forecast for earnings per share (EPS[10]) growth in 2019 for the information technology sector at negative 2%, the worst among all sectors. 'If profits decelerate in 2019 and 2020 and if we have a profit recession will this sector be immune? It won't be,' said Bernstein.The unresolved trade war[11] between the U.S. and China is not helping the earnings picture. Apple saw its shares tumble last year on signs of weak smartphone demand in China, but expectations that a trade deal would be reached have stimulated a rebound. So far, no deal has been agreed on, and there are now new worries of a technology 'Cold War'[12] between the world's two largest economies because of China's dominance in the information- and communication-technology supply chain[13].'If we are in a conflict and using infrastructure built by China, they could theoretically hit a button and shut off everything. After 30 years of saying companies should optimize supply chains and move some abroad, now we are saying it's a security concern,' Paul Triolo, practice head of geo-technology at political risk consulting firm Eurasia Group, told Barron's[14].Then there is the question of whether big tech has gotten too big, and what regulators will do about it. Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren is making the breakup of America's biggest tech companies a part of her campaign, which will make the regulation of the tech sector a key aspect of policy debates heading up to the election. A plan to breakup the big tech firms 'would be pretty impactful, depending on how it gets done,' Lee Spelman, head of U.S. equities for JPMorgan Asset Management, told the FT[15]. Looking Ahead The tech sector has become an investor favorite and there is still a lot of potential to automate even more productive processes and to take advantage of machine-learning tools, but at least in the near term, the sector will have a number of economic and political hurdles to overcome.

I've been doing venture capital for 20 years. Prior to that I had nearly 10 years at Microsoft where I had a number of roles. I was managing director of Australia for a number of years. But then I think my most important part of my Microsoft adventure was working in the US running one of the five product groups for nearly three years. Then came back and ran nine countries in Asia and then decided to retire for the first time. Then ended up back in venture capital.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">MCDULING: So that first Microsoft experience, that was - Microsoft is again I think the world's biggest company by market value but that was really its heyday when you were working there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">PETRE: Yes it was, yeah.</p><p>MCDULING: What was that experience like?</p><p>PETRE: Well it was the best working experience of my life bar none and primarily because of Bill Gates I think. By the way I think if we segue, if you look at the Microsoft under Bill Gates and the Microsoft under Satya Nadella they are very similar beasts in they are very product focused, deeply thought through product strategies. Whereas I think the Ballmer years were about sales. You can see that. I think the Microsoft resurgence is a function of Satya Nadella and a more product strategy focus and less high competition within the company product groups.</p><p>So it was a fantastic experience. I think working with someone like Bill Gates you learn so much about how to think about business and products and problem solving. So it was extraordinary experience and stayed with me for the rest of my life.</p><p>MCDULING: Is - are there any key lessons from the way Bill Gates manages people or manages a company that really stood out?</p><p>PETRE: Yeah I think - look a number of things. I think he doesn't suffer fools gladly. By that I mean you can't have random ideas without data. You can have ideas, they've got to be backed up. A good example would be if you came with a product strategy or a product plan you have to have thought it through deeply. Now - and that's important. So it means that when you move forward with that product plan, if something goes wrong you know what part of your assumption set was wrong and then you can fix it.</p><p>Very few companies historically in Australia ever did that. They just go, oh we should think about this, let's go do something. But if it goes wrong they don't know what to unpack to see what they should do next. So the sense of, if you've thought something through and you've really interrogated it and then you've agreed a plan, if it doesn't work out you know what went wrong and you can fix it.</p><p>The second part of that which was very instructive was, if something went wrong people weren't yelled at. It was, okay well what did we get wrong in our execution or what did we get wrong in our planning. Now of course, if you did the same - made the same mistake a few times you - there was a bit of a discussion. Fortunately I didn't have any of those experiences. But again, this sense of not a blame culture but more a learning culture. But very much focused on high intellectual focus on the problem at hand. That sort of process is something I've tried to take with me in other organisations that I've been involved with.</p><p>MCDULING: I think the period you were at Microsoft - as I said before it would have been the world's most valuable company. I think it was also the period when they were hit with the antitrust case?</p><p>PETRE: Yes, yes.</p><p>MCDULING: That was sort of - there's kind of parallels to now with regulators around the world sort of cracking down on the big tech companies do you think?</p><p>PETRE: Yes.</p><p>MCDULING: So what was that like inside Microsoft when that happened and do you think that - did they learn anything from that or was it just misguided regulation by - yeah.</p><p>PETRE: Well it's a bit of both I think. I think regulators are struggling to understand how to deal with companies that are being dominant in a space. Historically if you go back to the AT&amp;Ts and to those sort of dominant players and how was their behaviour, are they excluding competitors or making it unfair for competitors. I'm not sure the Microsoft case was that fair. Again if you unpack what was happening between operating system and applications and did the Windows applications get a real advantage out of the operating system where they were never bundled together.</p><p>So it was more the success of the company and surprisingly people who didn't commit to Windows early and so when Windows took off they were behind the eight ball. So a lot more things came into play there. I don't think Microsoft helped itself by some of the grandstanding of people like Steve Ballmer. That probably didn't help. But I think at its core there was not as much going on in a monopolistic sense as people I think assume. I think actually when you look at the actual resulting court cases that was actually true. You see there wasn't as much. Today I think there's a similar set of issues that need to be unpacked with a bit more nuance if you look at Google or Facebook.</p><p>MCDULING: Do you see any similarities between like a Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg just as an observer?</p><p>PETRE: Well they're obviously both incredibly bright people. I think Bill built a far better company with far less major disasters in terms of either actions or???</p><p>MCDULING: For society.</p><p>PETRE: Yeah just generally speaking he built a much stronger company in terms of the level of executives and the reporting that Mark Zuckerberg seems to have. Also I think Bill even though he didn't like it took on board some of the criticisms. Whereas Mark Zuckerberg seems to have taking that early, of you know, move fast, break things. Which is fine if you're 12 people. If you're the sort of company you are now with two billion consumers I don't think that approach really works that well.</p><p>MCDULING: So after the Microsoft stint you made the decision to move back home and you originally were at - ran Microsoft the whole Asia Pacific out of Sydney.</p><p>PETRE: Yeah. So well I was running a product group in Microsoft, there were five product groups. I was running work group which was sort of Outlook and exchange, all the communications products. Then actually my sister was killed in a car accident in Australia so we decided to move the family home to help my brother-in-law and my niece who was badly injured. Her six-month-old baby badly injured in the accident. Bill kindly offered to move the Asia Pacific headquarters from Seattle to Sydney so I had a job to do. So I came back and ran nine countries in Asia.</p><p>The problem with that was, once you've - I wasn't very good at sport but I imagine once you've played for the First 11 or First 15 or First 7 and then you're playing in the second division, it's still very good but you kind of want to be back there. So I think you become probably not as productive as you could be. I sensed myself becoming a bit negative and not fair to the people around me in Australia. So then I decided to leave after a few years.</p><p>MCDULING: Then the next big chapter of your career I guess was ecorp.</p><p>PETRE: Yeah, so yeah.</p><p>MCDULING: Which was with the Packers.</p><p>PETRE: Yeah. So I was - I'd gone back to uni to do a PhD and I didn't know what I was going to do. Then I was approached by a few companies actually, a few media companies, to come and do something in the tech space. I met with James and Kerry and I said here's what you need to do, free advice. They said, why don't you come and do it. So then I decided to form ecorp as a subsidiary of PBL and I hired Jeremy Philips who I'd met through McKinseys and off we went. That was a hilariously fun time. It was a great time.</p><p>Jeremy's extraordinarily smart. He's gone on to run one of the largest growth funds in the US with Spark. Again we were way ahead of the curve in terms of thinking through the impact of technologies. Most of those were coming out of the US in those days. Just thinking about how technology would disrupt market places in Australia.</p><p>MCDULING: That was sort of the first phase of the internet growth really?</p><p>PETRE: It was. Yeah that was the whole sort of '97 through to 2000 and then we had the crash. I think the mistake people made is they thought, oh well valuations were crushed therefore the companies are bad. Of course that's the wrong statement. There were a lot of valuations crushed with shit companies but a lot of great companies and yes the valuation was crushed but the companies went on to do well. As an example of eBay was a perfect example of that. So we did that for a number of years and then I tend to do my life in sort of five-year chunks so I decided I'd had enough. I went and said to Kerry, I'm leaving. I don't think he was that happy. I had nowhere to go, I just decided I'd had enough I want to do something else.</p><p>MCDULING: So was that when you took a - is that when you retired or is that???</p><p>PETRE: Well it's the second time, yeah. That's the second time.</p><p>MCDULING: Then - and what was it like working with Kerry and James?</p><p>PETRE: Look it was different working with - I mean Kerry needed to blame someone. Everything went wrong, had to blame someone. There wasn't the same level of intellect going into decisions. It was much more a, here's an idea let's go for it kind of thing. Which I wasn't used to. I was used to sort of thinking something through. Also, I didn't like a blame culture, I didn't think that was very useful. I think it doesn't engender a collegiate solving of problems. It doesn't engender being transparent about what's going on in the business. People tend to hide things. So that was - they were completely [counter-wise] I believe.</p><p>James is very good though, he gave us a lot of air cover to do what we needed to do. I mean Kerry was famously saying, well eBay's stupid, no-one would every use it. Because he didn't people would trust a platform. It sort of talked more about his personality than I think actually the business. But James was very good in supporting us and letting us get along and do it. That then worked well because then James went into SEEK and he rode quite a few horses in that race.</p><p>MCDULING: Then there was netus and now AirTree.</p><p>PETRE: Yeah. So netus was a - so then I stopped and then I thought, oh I seem to be pretty good at this, I might do it again. So Jeremy had gone to the US to work with Rupert at that stage and so I then - Alison Deans, who'd been this incredible hire we'd hired out of McKinseys to run eBay who then ran ecorp, she came with me. We then looked for a third person and Craig Blair came on the scene. So the three of us formed netus and we got a chunk of money from News Corp. Again it wasn't a subsidiary it was more a company with equity from News Corp and off we went again.</p><p>It was a bit different though this time. There was a bit of US investing platforms and more local investing as well. Whereas the first, eBay was - sorry ecorp was mainly US with a few Australian and netus was more Australian and a few US and then that trend's continued now with AirTree.</p><p>MCDULING: So AirTree as we were discussing earlier, I think was it now two years ago or three years ago, raised the biggest fund in???</p><p>PETRE: Yeah. So we started in sort of '14 raising. We raised a - we actually were raising a $40 million fund. We raised $80 million, thought we had too much money and we were going to blow it up so we pulled it back to $60 million. We realised in fact that $80 million was probably the right number because we invested that quite quickly and there were a lot more opportunities coming over the transom than we thought. Then we two years later raised $250 million, at that time was the largest fund. We'll probably raise that again - because of the cadence of investing now probably raise that again probably third quarter next year.</p><p>The difference I think between the ecorp, netus and AirTree years is just the cadence of new opportunities. In the netus years, in the five years of netus - of investing time in netus we probably saw 500 start???ups. We were seeing most of the good ideas. Not that it's a metric that matters but in AirTree we're seeing about 1000 a year. Part of that is because people can develop a start-up a lot more cheaply now because you can - the cloud and [borrow] marketing et cetera and shopping carts. So you just get a lot more opportunities that you can look at and therefore by definition there'll be a lot more good ones to invest in.</p><p>MCDULING: You're investing at a really interesting time for the tech industry in Australia.</p><p>PETRE: Yes.</p><p>MCDULING: You've been pretty outspoken about the government making some bad decisions when it comes to the tech sector. Can you talk us through some of the???</p><p>PETRE: Yeah I think it's part of a fundamental position which is that every job, every company and every industry is going to be impacted by technology more, not less as we move forward. You can't get away from that. Secondly, that it's all about software. Whether it's a camera or whether it's a car or whether it's a watch it's all going to be all about software. The third thing is that scale matters. More so than ever in the past. That a global successful platform will be able to penetrate a local market, whether or not you want to.</p><p>The best example would be advertising media in Australia. You go back 25 years, 100 cents in the Australian media spend was on Australian platforms and now it's got to be sub-50. Not because people have been forced to advertise on Google or on LinkedIn or on Facebook but because it provides a way better solution for advertiser return investment or a cost [of] acquisition of a consumer than traditional ones. That's without them having essentially any development down here, just some sales people down here fundamentally. Other than the case of Google who has quite a decent team working on???</p><p>MCDULING: Product and stuff, yeah.</p><p>PETRE: Yeah some product stuff. But not necessarily Australian product.</p><p>MCDULING: Yeah maps and things, yeah.</p><p>PETRE: Yeah. So I think that example tells you that technology matters. Also when you look forward it's quite clear that we're entering a time where there'll be a lot of job disruption because of technology. So you'd think in that framework you'd say, well we need to do everything we can to be the most innovative country we can in the world if we can and make us attractive for investment, attractive for talent. Pretty much the government's done everything it can to make us the antithesis of that. Our approach to skilled immigration has been appalling. The idea that we see all immigrants the same in skilled versus non-skilled.</p><p>You look in the US and 12 per cent of the US working population is foreign born. 35 per cent of the population in Silicon Valley is foreign born. 40-50 per cent of founders are foreign born. There's no question that immigrants have fuelled what is the greatest innovation system in the world and wealth creation system in the world. Even in Australia, 35 per cent of founders in Australia are foreign born. So just that immigration sort of lens, you'd say we should be doing everything we can. The whole GTS - the Global Talent Scheme has been a mess. I think there've been like, ooh seven people approved in eight months or seven months which is crazy.</p><p>Then you look at the approach on R&amp;D. At a time when every country around the world is investing more government dollars and private in R&amp;D, the Australian government took $2.4 billion out of the R&amp;D pile in the federal budget last year and has put that into general surplus. Today in the MYEFO they announced another $100 million coming out of block grants. I mean it's just - it is nearly criminal to at a time when we need to be investing more in breakthrough technology and more in research, we are taking money out.</p><p>The way they've gone after the start-ups in the - with the R&amp;D tax refund is madness. The approach to the AA bill which was the secrecy bill effectively. There are some issues we have to worry about, terrorism and secrecy but to apply it not just to messaging platforms but all software is ridiculous and it's going to completely screw a lot of platforms that have got nothing to do with cyber security. Design platforms like Canva or workflow platforms like Atlassian get trapped by this. Then the ACCC's overreach with Google and Facebook.</p><p>So again there are clearly issues with Google and Facebook about privacy access and things but to - this overreach where they need to understand the pricing algorithms for Google. Well when there was an oligopoly in the free-to-air television networks, when - did anyone ask for the pricing algorithms for Channel 9's pricing, no. Why not. So there's this whole sort of - I just have - I think the problem is many people in places of decision-making just don't understand what's going on. Fundamentally at a ministerial level and a senior departmental level, really at their core don't understand what's going on the world which is a little bit tragic.</p><p>MCDULING: Yeah. Is there - and maybe political reason - internal politics [unclear] reason?</p><p>PETRE: Oh look I think yeah, when Turnbull came out with the innovation statement I think maybe three years ago it was right on the money. He did very good things in terms of ESVCLP, the funding. It set an agenda. The problem was it didn't resonate with the average Australian and so then it was cast aside. The right response would have been, now we need to now work out how to bring the average Australian with us because this is the future. The mistake the government made and mainly because of the nutter right, was to just push that to the side and try and get back to basic politics, which is just the wrong story. You talk to anyone out there who is worried about jobs for their kids, schooling for their kids, there won't be jobs if we don't work out how to create an innovative economy.</p><p>MCDULING: There was a political question I was going to ask you. So I mean when - I'm not a political expert and things like that but it looks as though - if the polls are correct, it looks like there will be a change in government next year. Does the ALP make you any more optimistic about this stuff or is it a widespread [unclear]?</p><p>PETRE: Time will tell but Bill Shorten did a speech a couple of weeks and he hit on - which is probably one of the major issues of our country which is the spend of R&amp;D as a percentage of GDP. Australia is sitting sort of around the 1.4, 1.5 mark. The innovative countries are sitting at twos and threes and fours. That is a lot - a chunk to do with government pulling back and a large chunk with lazy Australian companies not investing in R&amp;D because they never had to because it was an oligopolistic structure.</p><p>So I think the fact that he's put that on the front burner, that we need to focus on research and development is a really, really good thing. So if that now translates into policies that support more research and development, more innovation, more skilled immigration, I think it's a good thing. It is diametrically opposed to where we see the current government being focused.</p><p>MCDULING: Do you think Australia's punching above its weight in tech or punching under its weight in tech?</p><p>PETRE: I think - and you break that up. If you look at research patents as a percentage versus R&amp;D expenditure, so per $100 million worth of research money Australia actually punches above its weight. If you look at the number of patents or papers - sort of proxies for the value of the research - per $100 million Australia does very, very well. We are up as high - we're up with the UK and the US. If you look at commercialisation of research we're on the floor and that's a lot to do with corporations not taking R&amp;D and commercialising it.</p><p>I think if you look at [unclear] you can say, well gee Australia's only got X hundred million invested in venture capital, we should be four times that. That's true in an absolute sense but on trend analysis we've gone from our industry raising maybe $150 million in 2014 to $2 billion last year. That's a fantastic trend. So I think we're coming into our own. I don't think we are - I think we're still punching under our weight in terms of our ability to build scaled technology companies but we're on the right trajectory.</p><p>The trick now is, don't screw it up. It's on the right trajectory. Companies are growing, they're adding high paid jobs. They're becoming global superstars like the [Canvas] of the world, the SafetyCultures of the world et cetera. Or even local superstars like the Prospers of the world. My theory is that in particular governments will do things that will just blow it up and then we'll go back to the bad old days where there's no money in the industry, no-one wants to invest and we'll have destroyed the future for Australia.</p><p>MCDULING: If you look at the US, I think the top five companies by market value are now all tech companies. You look at Australia, it's still probably BHP and the four banks it's something along those lines.</p><p>PETRE: Absolutely right. Yeah we're not there yet. There are good signs. I mean obviously Atlassian's on the US - on the NASDAQ but Atlassian's a great example. But also Aconex, although it was a [unclear] Aconex is a great example. Y-Tech's a great example, Canva's a great example. Then I think the good news is, if you go back say three or four years or companies who are valued at $10 million or $20 million or lower and now those companies are valued at $200 million, $300 million, $400 million, $500 million. So they're under the radar of most of the media and reporting but they are the next wave.</p><p>So I think the next two years we'll see a lot more companies - a lot more being valued at north of $500 million to north of $1 billion. That's - can you not - the Commonwealth Bank side, you're [starting to] build this super structure of companies that will grow. The issue will be that we just say - focus on, they are the more interesting companies because they are the ones hiring. If you look at the ASX top twenty, not a lot of those guys are actually doing their hiring.</p><p>So [they might] - and this - there is this discrepancy between valuation of company and labour engagement. Whereas the start-ups if you will have got valuation creation or value creation I should say and employee engagement which is where we want to end up.</p><p>MCDULING: If there was one thing the government could do to sort of fix these issues that you've been talking about, what would it be?</p><p>PETRE: Can I have two? One would be immigration. The world is starved of people like data scientists. I mean there's many categories. We'll pick one, data science. The US courtesy of Donald Trump has made the United States a place where dark skinned data scientists probably feel a bit uneasy to go there. That's where you can see this sort of issue the US has got at attracting talent now where it's always had a great talent. So this is a time we could be attracting some of the best data scientists in the world to help us grow Australian companies, hire more people, [create a cross] - a lot of leverage. So for us to have turned that tap off and been anti skilled immigration is foolish. Is at the extreme foolish. I would do that.</p><p>The other thing is we need to remember that the start-ups are the future of the country. They're people who have fundamentally taken 50 percent or 70 per cent reduction in salaries. They're doing something very risky. They're borrowing money initially from friends and family. We should be helping them grow, not trying to kill them off as seems to be the case with some of the R&amp;D refund approaches.</p><p>MCDULING: So not the encryption legislation? Would???</p><p>PETRE: No I mean the encryption - my - well there's - [unclear]. Yeah I think encryption legislation is a disaster. My theory is, no-one will touch it prior to election because no-one wants to be seen to be soft on security, right. It's like the - if you talk about more police you're going to get more votes. But the reality is it's terrible. It's so far reaching it's going to be incredibly damaging. I guess my belief is, post the election whoever's in government going to fix it because they're going to realise this is a disaster. We need to pull it back from its over reach to focus on the messaging platforms which are the ones that - I mean if you think about it, the issue was, the terrorists are using encrypted messaging systems to talk to each other.</p><p>Yes, we should have a way to understand that. How does that translate to a company that's got design tools. How does that translate to a company that does workflow management. I mean it's ludicrous. So I just think no-one's going to touch that because it's politically sensitive prior to election. You know soft on - anyone says, well we're going to change it, oh you're soft on security. Post the election hopefully sanity will prevail and they'll fix it and make it appropriate, fit for purpose as opposed to this ridiculous overreach.</p><p>MCDULING: I think the last question probably. I think we've gone on pretty well. But you've worked with some pretty amazing founders in your career. That's what you do every day. You're a founder yourself. I was just wondering, is there a single quality that the great founders have? Or one that you would highlight as the one that founders should aspire to have?</p><p>PETRE: Yeah people always say passion, that's it you've got to have passion. I don't subscribe to that. I subscribe to a mixture of high intellect, immense curiosity and be incredibly self-aware. If you get those things right, then you're applying high intellect to a problem but you're being really self-aware about how you're solving that problem and how good are you at that and what are other people doing and how do you make that better. That mix I think is the perfect mix for being a great founder.</p><p>MCDULING: Cool. Thanks very much.</p><p>PETRE: Thanks John.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520087386</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V61-JS11-DY19-C01M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4328\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Republicans' view that the tech industry plays favorites has grown, and there's more agreement than there used to be.\"</p><p>Because antitrust scrutiny and litigation is rooted in protecting consumers, Jamison thinks Democrats and Republicans will probably come up with legislation that focuses on protecting consumers served by the tech industry.</p><p>One easy way to do that is to draft a privacy law, which is already a top priority for House Democrats and Republicans.</p><p>\"Customers feel violated when people know things about them and it's very tempting for politicians to come to the rescue,\" Jamison said. \"As long as they focus on customer benefit, we should be ok. If they start moving down the path of, 'We're just worried about them because they're big or there are other social ills we want to cure using antitrust litigation,' then they start doing harm as opposed to good.\"</p><p>Follow Kate on Twitter</p><p>___ (c)2018 InsideSources.com, Washington, D.C.

One of the changes that happened in 2016, the new investigatory Powers act, was that our internet providers keep a record of everything we do online for a year so that police can dip into that if they want to. The thresholds are very low. </p><p>Snowden, when he blew the whistle on mass Google and Microsoft in the last two years with issues like facial recognition. You are starting to see a new generation of employee activism. Members of the organisation say, we care about the technology but most of us work here because we want to make the world better, so we don't like the way this technology might be used. What will you do as my employer to make sure we are safeguarded? I would argue the industry has not gone far enough, but these are the grassroots. Working in combination with organisations like yours, we can get a place where we can people like Oliver in his previous role to understand what is possible and what kind of regulation is required.

I don't mean that they don't want to protect the data they hold against intrusions of various kinds, but it doesn't matter to them terribly commercially. It's not going to damage their commerce. If we lose trust with Google and say, do you know what, I don't trust Google enough to give them my search data any more, the business is dead. So we have to trust them as much as we trust other competitors and as much as we need to in order to use their services.

So we have to trust them as much as we trust other competitors and as much as we need to in order to use their services. Understanding how they work is a core part of it. We don't help people outside the industry understand how this works. I think it is more difficult than you think, because you are clever about it than most people. It is not terribly in their commercial interests to worry about what happens if it all goes wrong briefly. It doesn't make a huge difference economically, but it makes a huge difference to us. Do you trust these big companies? No. Everyone is saying no behind me as well. I watch the programme a few weeks ago about a guy who took the Sim card is out of his phones, turn them off and went on a seven Day road trip around England. He plugged his phones in seven days later and it told him every single place where he went and where he was. I think we forget sometimes that these big tech companies, they are ultimately private businesses, and essentially they are about profit. They don't always put... Amoral. That's right. With Facebook specifically there was a massive thing where the were gathering enough data about people to target advertising to them. This is where regulation comes in, because after that, we all heard the stories, read about how our data had been abused, and what did we do? We carried on using Facebook for the vast majority. We don't take action in these things. It is so intrinsic to our lives now. Apparently, but we could jump to a million other social networks. It doesn't work that way. You can't jump to a network that no one else is using. If it is that big a concern, you could choose not to use the services. No one is forcing anyone to use Facebook. It is too seductive. That may be true and that is a societal question, but these companies are not evil for pursuing profit. Most of us don't understand it very well, but it is why we need a level of regulation, not overbearing, but a level of regulation to ensure that people who have got the time to understand what is going on can put appropriate controls in place. The problem with that is that the company is being regulated are writing the regulation. They are in there creating regulations that suit them, so of course they will call for regulation because they are massive companies that can get from the barriers created. We need to have alternatives like you're talking about, so we can have more choice and make sure that these big corporations face some pressure. Yes? He was talking... Who was? I do not know. Sorry. Tom? He was talking about activism within the organisation but that is not helpful when millions of people are waiting to join the company. They can get rid of anyone who does not toe the line. It is more useful to have activism within the community with movements that are run in the community by people in the community which are not beholden to shareholders, but only the users on the developers.

I agree that evidently these places are staffed by human beings with human feelings. Also, they do fantastic services for us all, as you were saying. Therefore, we become reliant on them. There are two dangerous. One is that it is not in their commercial interests particularly to protect our data. I don't mean that they don't want to protect the data they hold against intrusions of various kinds, but it doesn't matter to them terribly commercially. It's not going to damage their commerce. If we lose trust with Google and say, do you know what, I don't trust Google enough to give them my search data any more, the business is dead. So we have to trust them as much as we trust other competitors and as much as we need to in order to use their services. Understanding how they work is a core part of it. We don't help people outside the industry understand how this works. I think it is more difficult than you think, because you are clever about it than most people. It is not terribly in their commercial interests to worry about what happens if it all goes wrong briefly. It doesn't make a huge difference economically, but it makes a huge difference to us. Do you trust these big companies? No. Everyone is saying no behind me as well. I watch the programme a few weeks ago about a guy who took the Sim card is out of his phones, turn them off and went on a seven Day road trip around England. He plugged his phones in seven days later and it told him every single place where he went and where he was. I think we forget sometimes that these big tech companies, they are ultimately private businesses, and essentially they are about profit. They don't always put... Amoral. That's right. With Facebook specifically there was a massive thing where the were gathering enough data about people to target advertising to them. This is where regulation comes in, because after that, we all heard the stories, read about how our data had been abused, and what did we do? We carried on using Facebook for the vast majority. We don't take action in these things. It is so intrinsic to our lives now. Apparently, but we could jump to a million other social networks. It doesn't work that way. You can't jump to a network that no one else is using. If it is that big a concern, you could choose not to use the services. No one is forcing anyone to use Facebook. It is too seductive. That may be true and that is a societal question, but these companies are not evil for pursuing profit. Most of us don't understand it very well, but it is why we need a level of regulation, not overbearing, but a level of regulation to ensure that people who have got the time to understand what is going on can put appropriate controls in place. The problem with that is that the company is being regulated are writing the regulation. They are in there creating regulations that suit them, so of course they will call for regulation because they are massive companies that can get from the barriers created. We need to have alternatives like you're talking about, so we can have more choice and make sure that these big corporations face some pressure. Yes? He was talking... Who was? I do not know. Sorry. Tom? He was talking about activism within the organisation but that is not helpful when millions of people are waiting to join the company. They can get rid of anyone who does not toe the line. It is more useful to have activism within the community with movements that are run in the community by people in the community which are not beholden to shareholders, but only the users on the developers.

What will you do as my employer to make sure we are safeguarded? I would argue the industry has not gone far enough, but these are the grassroots. Working in combination with organisations like yours, we can get a place where we can people like Oliver in his previous role to understand what is possible and what kind of regulation is required. </p><p>Regulation is the critical point. I agree that evidently these places are staffed by human beings with human feelings. Also, they do fantastic services for us all, as you were saying. Therefore, we become reliant on them. There are two dangerous. One is that it is not in their commercial interests particularly to protect our data. I don't mean that they don't want to protect the data they hold against intrusions of various kinds, but it doesn't matter to them terribly commercially. It's not going to damage their commerce. If we lose trust with Google and say, do you know what, I don't trust Google enough to give them my search data any more, the business is dead. So we have to trust them as much as we trust other competitors and as much as we need to in order to use their services. Understanding how they work is a core part of it. We don't help people outside the industry understand how this works. I think it is more difficult than you think, because you are clever about it than most people. It is not terribly in their commercial interests to worry about what happens if it all goes wrong briefly. It doesn't make a huge difference economically, but it makes a huge difference to us. Do you trust these big companies? No. Everyone is saying no behind me as well. I watch the programme a few weeks ago about a guy who took the Sim card is out of his phones, turn them off and went on a seven Day road trip around England. He plugged his phones in seven days later and it told him every single place where he went and where he was. I think we forget sometimes that these big tech companies, they are ultimately private businesses, and essentially they are about profit. They don't always put... Amoral. That's right. With Facebook specifically there was a massive thing where the were gathering enough data about people to target advertising to them. This is where regulation comes in, because after that, we all heard the stories, read about how our data had been abused, and what did we do? We carried on using Facebook for the vast majority. We don't take action in these things. It is so intrinsic to our lives now. Apparently, but we could jump to a million other social networks. It doesn't work that way. You can't jump to a network that no one else is using. If it is that big a concern, you could choose not to use the services. No one is forcing anyone to use Facebook. It is too seductive. That may be true and that is a societal question, but these companies are not evil for pursuing profit. Most of us don't understand it very well, but it is why we need a level of regulation, not overbearing, but a level of regulation to ensure that people who have got the time to understand what is going on can put appropriate controls in place. The problem with that is that the company is being regulated are writing the regulation. They are in there creating regulations that suit them, so of course they will call for regulation because they are massive companies that can get from the barriers created. We need to have alternatives like you're talking about, so we can have more choice and make sure that these big corporations face some pressure. Yes? He was talking... Who was? I do not know. Sorry. Tom? He was talking about activism within the organisation but that is not helpful when millions of people are waiting to join the company. They can get rid of anyone who does not toe the line. It is more useful to have activism within the community with movements that are run in the community by people in the community which are not beholden to shareholders, but only the users on the developers. You can see the code and modify the code and you know they are not messing around and you</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BBC1WA-84555486083b4f258b6f2b716d80b307</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BBC1WA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCK-38G1-JBH6-C4MC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">402024</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 TVEyes, Inc.

No one knew if it was true, of course, but word spread quickly, and shares bought for 10 cents soared to $2.50.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The hype hit its peak four years later, when Athabasca went public at $18 per share. It was a triumph for the company's earliest backers, whose returns ranged from 600% to something-that-will-make-you-cry, and it was an undisputed victory for the independent investment dealers that underwrote the IPO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Seven of Athabasca's 11 underwriters were scrappy independents, and they earned the biggest chunk of the $81-million commission cheque. Of the indies, GMP Securities, the colead adviser, made the most. In typical GMP fashion, employees popped Champagne the day Athabasca hit the market.</p><p>Fast-forward six years, and all that seems like a dream. In January, GMP slashed nearly one-quarter of its staff, and its rival independents are cutting to the bone. Some have shut down altogether. Dundee Securities, owned by the once-glorified Ned Goodman, sold its retail brokerage to Euro Pacific in January, and its investment bank is likely to be bought out by its own employees to help shield Dundee from more pain.</p><p>The neutering of Canada's independent brokerages comes courtesy of several factors. Commodity deals, once the boutiques' bread and butter, have plummeted, with the mining sector depressed and the Big Banks sucking up much of the remaining energy work. The trading game has changed, too. The rise of the machines has sidelined many traders and compressed commissions to a fraction of what they used to be.</p><p>You might be asking yourself: So what if a bunch of oldschool traders and bankers disappear from the Street? So the media will have fewer bon vivants to write about. But that's not the only consequence of this shift. It raises serious questions about the very future of Canadian innovation and our ability to uncover the next tech or mining star.</p><p>Peter Brown, the man who built Canaccord, one of the few contemporary independents to rival GMP in swagger, doesn't mince words. If his firm were starting from scratch in 2016, he swears it wouldn't stand a chance. \"I don't think you can do it today,\" he laments. \"It's a broken model.\"</p><p>The boutique that epitomized the BSD was Gordon Capital and its founder, Jimmy Connacher (a.k.a. the Piranha), a man who prided himself on doing what more established firms wouldn't. \"We wouldn't say no,\" Connacher once said. \"We were outside the box all the time.\"</p><p>That applied equally to work and play (which is why Gordon is still legendary, despite being acquired by HSBC in 1998, by which time it was a shell of its former self). Legends abound. Connacher, they say, once showed up to a Christmas party wearing nothing but a string of lights, and two female secretaries received breast implants as a bonus. There was a corporate yacht, the G-Force, available for private dalliances, and a butler named Basil to serve drinks so traders wouldn't have to leave their phones. Every Friday, employees were invited into the Fishbowl, the glass-walled executive suite, for a catered lunch, complete with wine. When the weekly lunch moved to Rodney's Oyster House (the catering bills having reached astronomical heights), the gathering would often stretch well into the night.</p><p>No matter how late and how drunken the nights were, though, each day at Gordon began with a meeting at 7:30 a.m. sharp, and by the mid-1980s, Gordon accounted for an average of 15% of daily trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p><p>Brad Griffiths, a onetime Gordon star who died in 2011, likened the place to Hotel California: \"It was tough to get into and tough to get out.\" When it began to fade, Griffiths fled and set up his own shop, GMP Capital, with corporate lawyer Gene McBurney. \"We wanted to do exactly what Gordon did in the '80s,\" McBurney explains by phone from the Bahamas, where he has just landed after five days in Colombia. \"We thought it had lost its way.\"</p><p>Reviving the business included reigniting the after-work shenanigans. McBurney doesn't deny GMP and its rivals played hard, but argues that the best firms, like his, were still loaded with smart people. \"It wasn't a bunch of yahoos getting together and throwing darts at a dart board,\" he says.</p><p>Indeed, even GMP's rivals bowed down to the brains and work ethic of its star trader, Mike Wekerle, a.k.a. Wek. The man practically had his own orbit. Tattooed, with shaggy blond hair, he looked more like someone from Kid Rock's posse than Bay Street's best market-maker. He started at First Marathon Securities at 19 and jumped to GMP when it launched 13 years later. Wek could work at a torrential pace during the day and then endure legendary, alcohol-fuelled escapades after markets closed. At various points, he owned a Porsche GT, a beach house on Harbour Island in the Bahamas, and a stake in chichi Toronto restaurant Splendido. Seymour Schulich once told this magazine that Wek had \"the balls of a cat burglar.\"</p><p>Of course, there was a more staid side to some of the independents. Lawrence Bloomberg, who founded First Marathon in 1979, was a wiry runner whose parties, his friends would joke, ended with liqueurs on the driveway because he went to bed so early. But in 1993, Bloomberg earned a then-hefty $6.9 million. Justifying such payments, First Marathon offered this explanation: \"These people are all-stars.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, at the Big Banks, multiple divisions shared profit pools, so a fixed-income loss might hurt equity traders. And there was (and still is) an unwritten rule that no one should expect to make more than the group heads, and the group heads should never make more than the bank's CEO.</p><p>That was blasphemy to the independents. At GMP, 60% of fees went to cover expenses and non-partner salaries, and the rest went to the bonus pool and partners. Better yet, the cheques came quickly-often monthly. \"If you got paid double the CEO, he'd pat you on the back,\" one investment banker remembers fondly. In 2002, former GMP Calgary rainmaker Tom Budd made $12.5 million, roughly double the head of Canada's biggest bank.</p><p>The paycheques were so massive because the partners (who also owned the dealers) got a cut of profits as part of their annual compensation, and because they had a direct claim on the business they brought in. \"It was an eat-what-you-kill environment,\" says Jim Davidson, one of FirstEnergy Capital's cofounders. \"If you brought in a $12-million M&amp;A fee, you had a great year-and you deserved to have a great year.\"</p><p>That tended to lure employees with an appetite for risk. Think of it as choosing between a career in government (the Big Banks) or at a start-up (the independents). Working at a Big Bank guaranteed a decent, somewhat stable income. Working for an independent was riskier but came with the prospect of huge scores. \"You tended to get the best and the brightest, and they tended to be young,\" says Davidson, who was 33 when he helped set up FirstEnergy.</p><p>The brokerages selected for aggression, too. \"I'd take an exjock with a B+ average over an academic with an A+ average,\" McBurney says frankly. He wanted people who were driven to win-without relying on a Big Bank brand name to woo clients.</p><p>The effects were tangible. Bankers at Gordon Capital-considered an outsider even among other, larger brokerages like Wood Gundy and Dominion Securities-single-handedly invented the bought deal in 1982 (over Scotch, of course) as a way of getting in on a deal for Canadian Utilities. Instead of telling clients they'd do their best to raise money for them (while fighting for fees with the other dealers), Gordon fronted the cash and absorbed all the risk that came with selling the new shares to investors. The bought deal is now the dominant equity-financing vehicle in Canada.</p><p>Independents were also more comfortable playing in grey areas, something one former trader referred to as \"flirting with the edges of acceptability.\"</p><p>The best of these dealers had ringleaders who were tapped into Bay Street's information flow. Wek got the most glory, but there were others, including Canaccord's Graham Saunders (better known as Suds), and John (Johnny E) Esteireiro of Genuity (which was run by David Kassie, once one of Bay Street's best-paid and most aggressive investment bankers).</p><p>On trading desks, information was a special currency. A ringleader might get a tip about the next big tech start-up or junior miner and tell his friends about it (a practice that, in some cases, amounted to blatant stock promotion). Long before it was confirmed that Athabasca had about seven billion barrels of oil in the ground, GMP-one of its earliest backers-helped persuade some of Bay Street's top fund managers to invest; Dynamic's Rohit Sehgal put in $10 million.</p><p>With publicly traded companies, a ringleader might call his closest fund managers to assess the appetite for a new gold financing-without giving away the name of the company, since that would be illegal. Fund managers who correctly guessed the issuer could make money by shorting its shares, since bought deals are sold at a discount to entice investors, forcing the issuer's stock price to fall.</p><p>In exchange for the tidbit, the fund manager might step up with a buzz-making lead order on a new financing or to bolster a deal that was struggling to sell. And most likely, they'd book their next order with the firm's trading desk.</p><p>You might wonder how all this got past internal compliance rules. The short answer: The guidelines at independents were a little more lax. They were often more willing to let employees personally invest in companies they were doing business with-forbidden at bank-owned dealers. (Last year, National Bank Financial banned employees from even trading individual stocks in their personal accounts.)</p><p>Outside watchdogs would hit the brakes when they could. The Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada dinged Canaccord with a $1.1-million penalty in 2013 in part for not paying close enough attention to which of its clients were investing in risky companies. (Mom-and-pop investors are supposed to be steered away from the most volatile stuff.) First Marathon was slapped for allowing employees to act as investors, promoters and underwriters for junior mining and tech stocks in the early 1990s-against the interests of their clients. The most famous of all was Cartaway Resources: First Marathon employees bought control of the shell company on the Alberta Stock Exchange and pumped its share price to $26 within two years. The stock crashed to $2 after geological reports proved it was overhyped.</p><p>Disruption often seems to happen overnight-one day taxis are the only game in town; the next, it's all Uber. But dig a little deeper and you'll find that the demise of the independents has been a long time coming.</p><p>The first salvo came in 1987, when the feds opened the doors to bank-owned investment dealers. Four of the largest indies-among them Dominion Securities and Nesbitt Thomson-were quickly swallowed (by RBC and Bank of Montreal, respectively), turning the banks into formidable players almost overnight.</p><p>For the next two decades, there was enough business to go around-the independents simply had to be more aggressive. The banks were less likely to touch companies with no profit (and sometimes even no revenue). But Canaccord and other independents swept the corners to find emerging companies in need of creative financing ideas. Then they'd propose, say, a zero-coupon bond, which lets clients borrow money interest-free up-front, with the interest paid as a lump sum when the bond matures. More risk, big potential payout.</p><p>The Big Banks' edge over the indies sped up after the dotcom bust, when commodities like oil and gold popped. Suddenly, the resource business was a heckuva lot more interesting. And as mining and energy companies began looking for corporate loans to fuel their growth, the banks swooped in with money the brokerages couldn't provide.</p><p>Around the same time, the world of stock trading was disrupted. It used to be that portfolio managers had to go through a human being to trade shares, with the middleman charging a five-cent commission per share. Now, computers could just as easily line up buyers and sellers-at one-fifth the cost. Shrinking commissions were only half the problem. Because they weren't in the middle of trades, ringleaders had less information to use as currency.</p><p>Electronic trading hurt the banks, too, but they had other business lines to lean on. Derivatives, for one, are now a crucial component of mergers and acquisitions, guaranteeing a company the ability to, say, sell gold for $1,200 (U.S.) an ounce, regardless of the market price. That guarantee can make the acquisition of a rival gold miner less risky-and the fees for those derivative transactions can bring in more money than traditional M&amp;A advice.</p><p>There's a lot of bitterness on the Street, and it runs deep. In a letter to employees in January, on the day GMP cut 73 employees, CEO Harris Fricker defended the move, arguing \"there will be no regulatory rollback of anti-competitive practices as the amorphous blob that is the bank oligopoly will continue to expand in search of new revenues and earnings.\"</p><p>Fricker et al. wouldn't be this angry if the commodity market was still smoking hot. Independents made a killing in 2010 and 2011, when energy and mining deals were through the roof. But they do have some legitimate points. While the major global banks caused the financial crisis, smaller dealers are the ones suffering from the resulting regulatory crackdown. The extra compliance costs post-2008-such as installing systems to monitor trades more closely-can be crippling for indie shops.</p><p>New client \"suitability\" rules-meant to ensure mom-and-pop investors don't get duped-have raised ire, too. Brown says he knows a 76-year-old in Vancouver who made his fortune bringing three mines to production. The man recently asked his broker at a Big Six bank to put $150,000 into a new mining venture. The broker refused, arguing it wasn't suitable for someone his age-despite the client's expertise and riches. Regulators, Brown argues, \"do not understand the unintended consequences of what they do.\" If even wealthy Canadians can't bet on the next great miners, how will these companies ever raise the early capital needed to grow?</p><p>Same goes for the independents-if they disappear, who will bet on unknown companies desperate for cash? When Canadian Natural Resources was still small, First Marathon and Calgary's Peters &amp; Co. led early financing rounds. When Canadian investors were too timid to take a bet on Research In Motion, GMP took the company public in 1995, selling shares to U.S. investors. These two corporations combined have been worth more than $100 billion, attracting global investors and giving Canadians something to be proud of.</p><p>Sure, sometimes it got ugly. Athabasca, for one, crashed and burned. Though its shares debuted at $18 in 2010, they soon cratered. It turns out there is such a thing as too much hype, and public investors eventually saw through it. Canada's IPO market went into a state of shock-and everyone blamed GMP. But the banks aren't perfect, either: During the income-trust era, they made huge commissions taking some questionable companies public. And to date, one of Canada's highest-profile tipping scandals erupted inside RBC Dominion Securities, the most blue-chip of the country's investment dealers.</p><p>So are the independents dead? Not quite-but they do need to evolve. Too many still rely on their trading desks, which in years past brought in enough money to keep the lights on. Investment banking fees were the gravy. That model is now inverted, meaning the bankers carry the burden of keeping the firms afloat. There's more to keep above water, too, since the independents are much bigger than they used to be. Some of them used the money they made during the commodity boom to expand to London and Houston and New York.</p><p>At GMP, it's telling-and definitely a good thing-that the cuts were largely aimed at the old-school sales and trading business. What's unknown is whether the bankers who remain have what it takes to restore the glory-at GMP and all the independents. Almost all of the old stars, the ones who slugged it out with the Big Banks before the commodity boom brought in easy fees, have left the business. It's up to the current class to prove they're just as good as the bad boys who groomed them.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GLOBML-GAM20160226rbmbigshrink</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GLOBML2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5J5N-N7C1-JCRP-C2SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">303830</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2793\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Globe and Mail, a division of CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc.

At the Interactive Advertising Bureau, Randall Rothenberg, who held the top spot for 14 years, is stepping into an executive chairman role , while David Cohen, IAB president since March, is taking over.    Not only will Cohen become CEO of IAB, he also inherits that same mantle at the IAB Tech Lab, which develops ad industry standards. That confederation makes sense, with the worlds of privacy regulations, big tech policies and the need for common standards colliding.    Cohen has a big task ahead of him and we\u2019ll outline his biggest priorities as he steers the IAB and the IAB Tech Lab into an uncertain future.    And also, Facebook in February 2021 will start limiting how many ads a page can run . Its rationale: It\u2019ll help its proprietary machine learning understand which ads are effective if marketers throw less messaging onto Facebook\u2019s walls, thus paving the way to improve performance and pricing.    Sounds like a win for marketers except, again, they\u2019ll have to cede significant control to a walled garden. (Stop me if you\u2019ve heard that one before.)    But as things change, they also stay the same. Taboola and Outbrain were once planning to merge to create the monster link recommendation site you\u2019ve always wanted. Now, no more . The reported reason: business practices Taboola initiated that cost it some pretty big customers.    Tune in this week to hear how it all went down.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WBNEN-43045841998</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WBNEN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60TC-RNJ1-JCSC-J2JG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382768</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"288\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>No Copyright - Moreover</copyright><publicationName>Ad Exchanger</publicationName><aggregationName>WebNews - English</aggregationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 10, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>WebLinks</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>General</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Social media platforms are the prime example here. With each new user, the pool of potential connections and scope for content sharing increases. Once critical mass has been achieved, it is hard for rivals to lure users away from the market leaders.  <br/>For Google, this effect is visible through its algorithmic improvements: each search conducted on its platforms improves the usability and efficiency of its services. For Amazon, the more merchants and consumers that are on its site, the more valuable it becomes to both buyers and sellers.  <br/>By delivering \u201cnatural monopolies\u201d, the network effect has created a number of market darlings, but this degree of market control has also made regulators twitchy. Google captures over 85% of desktop search queries, a number that rises to 95% on mobile. At the end of 2017, Facebook had over 2 billion monthly active users. In 2017, Amazon commanded almost half - some 48% - of all US online retail, up five percentage points year-over-year. Even so, through the traditional lens of anti-trust policy - focused on prices and harm to consumers \u2013 it is difficult to accuse these businesses of abusing their market power.<br/> Benevolent monopolists?  <br/>For a start, most of the products provided by Google and Facebook are ostensibly free, resulting in huge consumer surplus. One study cited in the Economist estimated that users value \u201csearch\u201c at around $16,600 per year, maps at $2,800 and video at $900. Google also provides its Android operating system free of charge to third party device manufacturers (largely, of course, to secure its dominance in mobile search).  <br/>Clearly, we as users are creating value for the firms as they harvest our data, which they can then monetise through sales to advertisers. In surveys, consumers claim that we value our data highly and are not willing to trade it for services, but our behaviour strongly suggests otherwise. We unthinkingly tick consent boxes and allow cookies rather than interrupt our browsing/purchasing experience, and data breaches appear to have little to no impact on our behaviour. A recent study found that students were prepared to offer up their email contact lists for as little as a free pizza.  <br/>Forthcoming GDPR regulation will in theory allow consumers in the EU to withhold their data, but it is very hard to see many users not consenting to share their data if the alternative is to be \u2018cut off\u2019 from services they use multiple times a day. In any case, the value of any individual\u2019s data on its own is negligible: the reason networks are so valuable is because of the sheer volume of data they collect. If pushed by regulators, one could envisage Google and Facebook introducing a \u2018freemium\u2019 model, whereby consumers either pay a premium for privacy or continue to trade data for free services: our bet is most would stick with the status quo.  <br/>So is it the advertisers that are being squeezed on price? Here too, the evidence is far from damning. Google\u2019s ad pricing is determined by auction, so they are not price-gouging on this front; Facebook\u2019s is set by the company but their current \u201ccost per thousand impressions\u201d (CPM) is still only around $2, cheaper than almost any other media. Looking at it another way, Facebook currently generates revenue of just $20 a year from each user \u2013 almost all from advertising \u2013 versus a value of $750 that users derive from the platform according to a recent MIT study. Facebook has been particularly cautious of increasing its ad load, wary that any improvement in near-term monetisation might come at the cost of reduced user engagement. This is exactly the kind of behaviour we hope to see from \u201csustainable\u201d companies.  <br/>Amazon\u2019s business model is very different, but again we see little evidence here to see that their dominance of ecommerce is resulting in consumer harm. In fact, Amazon\u2019s disruptive impact has resulted in massive deflation across a wide range of products and industries, largely by cutting out the middleman of distribution/retail and improving price transparency. The reality or threat of being \u201cAmazoned\u201d has prompted innovation across the economy.  <br/>In the most traditional sense therefore, consumers do not appear to have been harmed by the market dominance of these firms.<br/> Creative destruction  <br/>Tech giants have also been accused of stifling innovation by gobbling up promising start-ups and monopolising the best talent. Google, in particular, has such a huge balance sheet and such a broad reach \u2013 from internet balloons to drones to \u201csmart\u201d contact lenses that measure blood glucose levels \u2013 that it could be argued to be \u201ccrowding out\u201d potential innovators. Critics point to the precipitous decline in the number of start-ups in recent decades, with most years seeing more companies fail than start.  <br/>In our view, Google and Amazon have not only been hugely innovative on their own account but also prompted new and established companies across the economy to raise their game. In the same way that Amazon dragged retail into the 21st century, Google has put the fire under telecoms operators to accelerate their rollout of high-speed broadband and the auto industry to invest in developing self-driving cars.  <br/>Start-up activity, growth, and entrepreneurship have ticked up encouragingly since 2014, suggesting the dip was more a function of the economic environment than structural change.  <br/>That said, we do agree that in hindsight it was too lax of regulators to allow Facebook to acquire Whatsapp and Instagram, both of which could have gone on to become potential competitors. Disruptive competition cannot emerge if the tech giants are allowed to subsume all possible rivals. We also have more sympathy with the view that flouting of copyright laws by YouTube in particular is damaging to the creative industries.<br/> Soap box or echo chamber?  <br/>Things become more difficult to gauge \u2013 particularly in reference to social media - when we step away from pure economics.  <br/>The unprecedented level of access to data enables subdivision and targeting of audiences on social media far more effectively than ever possible for conventional media. Even in its most benign application, profiling social media users can mean that a tailored content experience only ever echoes existing views, hindering effective and informed debate. The more malign use of this data, of course, could be to more directly manipulate what a user sees.  <br/>Social media can, on the other hand, be seen as an important platform for free speech. It can elevate civic engagement: a boon to democracy, especially for marginalised or repressed groups. For example, Facebook played an important role during the 2011 Arab Spring, allowing protestors to disseminate information, organise demonstrations, and raise local and global awareness of events.    <br/>This leads us to ask to what degree social media platforms should continue to be treated as just that \u2013 platforms \u2013 versus publishers, which would entail taking responsibility for content posted on them. If widely mandated, this would be extremely challenging due to the sheer volume of content. The equivalent of 65 years worth of video is uploaded to YouTube every day. Already, Facebook, and to a lesser extent YouTube, are proactively increasing their scrutiny of content, improving their Artificial intelligence and hiring real people to identify and remove false and extremist material. Germany has recently introduced legislation threatening fines of up to \u20ac50 million for platforms that fail to adequately police their content, with the result that Facebook now has over one-sixth of its moderators in Germany, compared to just 1.5% of its users. Yet balancing the need to protect users without tipping over into censorship is extremely difficult, risking reputational damage and undermining user engagement.<br/> For the greater good?  <br/>Measuring \u201csocial value\u201d, and how much of it is created or destroyed by big tech, is far from straightforward. On balance, we are comfortable that \u2013 for now at least \u2013 these companies are contributing more to society in the form of free products and innovation than they are detracting by monopolising our data and crimping competition. We will, however, continue to monitor developments and remain wary of tail risks that could threaten the long-term durability of their business models. We see the most likely risk as taking the form of regulation on the one hand and/or consumer backlash on the other </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">RVMPCU-RLPMN618797220180223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">RVMPCU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RR4-CCB1-DXCW-D2W6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">424987</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1680\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Plus Media Solutions Private Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Plus Company Updates(PCU)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45923\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 23, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

When it comes to wrangling Big Tech, Australia appears to be doing the opposite: yelling loudly and wielding a twig.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was a lot of strong rhetoric on Friday from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher and competition tsar Rod Sims about the unrivalled power of tech giants, which, despite being the most valuable businesses in history, remain largely unregulated and unaccountable.</p><p>But there was also not a huge amount in terms of new measures to deal with this intractable problem.</p><p>Sure, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's final, 623-page report from its long-running digital platforms inquiry diagnoses the problem - Google and Facebook's market power - and recommends measures that will upset the two digital giants.</p><p>These include the strengthening of privacy laws, tightening merger rules to prevent the giants from gobbling up emerging competitors, and the establishment of a new division within the ACCC to scrutinise the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook news feeds.</p><p>But these measures, broadly speaking, were already flagged in the ACCC's interim report in December. And the global push to regulate Big Tech has intensified significantly since then.</p><p>One new recommendation that did pique observers' interest on Friday is a requirement for the companies to set up codes of conduct for their interactions with media businesses.</p><p>It's difficult to get terribly excited about the phrase \"code of conduct\" - such requirements have proved woefully ineffective in other industries, most notably financial services.</p><p>But media executives were legitimately encouraged by this announcement. The codes of conduct would be governed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, which oversees similar regimes in television and radio. They could finally give publishers and broadcasters the ability to bargain with Google and Facebook over the fair use of their content.</p><p>At the same time, the ACCC's final report backed away from some other measures that the media industry was hoping for. For example, an earlier suggestion that subscriptions to newspapers producing public interest journalism be tax deductible is now off the table.</p><p>The unmistakable vibe from Friday's proceedings is that the government is genuinely concerned about the power of big technology companies, and the impact that is having on consumers and parts of the economy.</p><p>From a media perspective, that is pleasing. Yet given recent events - raids on the home of a journalist and the offices of the public broadcaster among them - scepticism is still warranted.</p><p>Since the ACCC interim report was released in December, antagonism towards Big Tech has racheted up globally, particularly in the US. Washington is a bitterly divided place - about the only thing uniting the two sides of politics there at the moment is the need to act against the giants of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, has been the chief protagonist on the political left, earlier this year unveiling a formal policy for Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon to be broken apart on competition grounds.</p><p>Meanwhile, the powerful Department of Justice, which is under the purview of President Donald Trump, this week started its own investigation into internet platforms. It has the potential to be much more damaging to these companies than anything happening in Australia.</p><p>The US actually has a long history of splitting up its biggest companies. It stretches back more than a century, when Roosevelt, the last Republican from New York to occupy the White House, was in power. He gained a reputation as a \"trust-buster\" after taking on the dominant railroad and oil companies of that age. More recently, in the 1980s, under the staunchly pro-market Reagan administration, telecommunications behemoth AT&amp;T was torn apart.</p><p>We might well see history repeat itself. Facebook this week disclosed it had paid a $US5 billion ($7.1 billion) fine to the Federal Trade Commission, which is broadly analogous to the ACCC, for privacy breaches. The FTC then proceeded to announce its own, separate investigation into Facebook's market power.</p><p>The notion that the social media behemoth could be forced to divest its secondary platforms Instagram and/or WhatsApp no longer seems out of the question. Likewise, that the US tries to force Google to separate its search engine from its display advertising business, or that Apple or Amazon's wings are clipped also cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The Big Tech backlash is here.

When it comes to wrangling Big Tech, Australia appears to be doing the opposite: yelling loudly and wielding a twig.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was a lot of strong rhetoric on Friday from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher and competition tsar Rod Sims about the unrivalled power of tech giants, which, despite being the most valuable businesses in history, remain largely unregulated and unaccountable.</p><p>But there was also not a huge amount in terms of new measures to deal with this intractable problem.</p><p>Sure, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's final, 623-page report from its long-running digital platforms inquiry diagnoses the problem - Google and Facebook's market power - and recommends measures that will upset the two digital giants.</p><p>These include the strengthening of privacy laws, tightening merger rules to prevent the giants from gobbling up emerging competitors, and the establishment of a new division within the ACCC to scrutinise the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook news feeds.</p><p>But these measures, broadly speaking, were already flagged in the ACCC's interim report in December. And the global push to regulate Big Tech has intensified significantly since then.</p><p>One new recommendation that did pique observers' interest on Friday is a requirement for the companies to set up codes of conduct for their interactions with media businesses.</p><p>It's difficult to get terribly excited about the phrase \"code of conduct\" - such requirements have proved woefully ineffective in other industries, most notably financial services.</p><p>But media executives were legitimately encouraged by this announcement. The codes of conduct would be governed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, which oversees similar regimes in television and radio. They could finally give publishers and broadcasters the ability to bargain with Google and Facebook over the fair use of their content.</p><p>At the same time, the ACCC's final report backed away from some other measures that the media industry was hoping for. For example, an earlier suggestion that subscriptions to newspapers producing public interest journalism be tax deductible is now off the table.</p><p>The unmistakable vibe from Friday's proceedings is that the government is genuinely concerned about the power of big technology companies, and the impact that is having on consumers and parts of the economy.</p><p>From a media perspective, that is pleasing. Yet given recent events - raids on the home of a journalist and the offices of the public broadcaster among them - scepticism is still warranted.</p><p>Since the ACCC interim report was released in December, antagonism towards Big Tech has racheted up globally, particularly in the US. Washington is a bitterly divided place - about the only thing uniting the two sides of politics there at the moment is the need to act against the giants of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, has been the chief protagonist on the political left, earlier this year unveiling a formal policy for Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon to be broken apart on competition grounds.</p><p>Meanwhile, the powerful Department of Justice, which is under the purview of President Donald Trump, this week started its own investigation into internet platforms. It has the potential to be much more damaging to these companies than anything happening in Australia.</p><p>The US actually has a long history of splitting up its biggest companies. It stretches back more than a century, when Roosevelt, the last Republican from New York to occupy the White House, was in power. He gained a reputation as a \"trust-buster\" after taking on the dominant railroad and oil companies of that age. More recently, in the 1980s, under the staunchly pro-market Reagan administration, telecommunications behemoth AT&amp;T was torn apart.</p><p>We might well see history repeat itself. Facebook this week disclosed it had paid a $US5 billion ($7.1 billion) fine to the Federal Trade Commission, which is broadly analogous to the ACCC, for privacy breaches. The FTC then proceeded to announce its own, separate investigation into Facebook's market power.</p><p>The notion that the social media behemoth could be forced to divest its secondary platforms Instagram and/or WhatsApp no longer seems out of the question. Likewise, that the US tries to force Google to separate its search engine from its display advertising business, or that Apple or Amazon's wings are clipped also cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The Big Tech backlash is here. But Australia is no longer leading the charge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520160217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNB-SDW1-DY19-C27T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><timeReceived>04:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

When it comes to wrangling Big Tech, Australia appears to be doing the opposite: yelling loudly and wielding a twig.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There was a lot of strong rhetoric on Friday from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, Communications Minister Paul Fletcher and competition tsar Rod Sims about the unrivalled power of tech giants, which, despite being the most valuable businesses in history, remain largely unregulated and unaccountable.</p><p>But there was also not a huge amount in terms of new measures to deal with this intractable problem.</p><p>Sure, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's final, 623-page report from its long-running digital platforms inquiry diagnoses the problem - Google and Facebook's market power - and recommends measures that will upset the two digital giants.</p><p>These include the strengthening of privacy laws, tightening merger rules to prevent the giants from gobbling up emerging competitors, and the establishment of a new division within the ACCC to scrutinise the algorithms that power Google searches and Facebook news feeds.</p><p>But these measures, broadly speaking, were already flagged in the ACCC's interim report in December. And the global push to regulate Big Tech has intensified significantly since then.</p><p>One new recommendation that did pique observers' interest on Friday is a requirement for the companies to set up codes of conduct for their interactions with media businesses.</p><p>It's difficult to get terribly excited about the phrase \"code of conduct\" - such requirements have proved woefully ineffective in other industries, most notably financial services.</p><p>But media executives were legitimately encouraged by this announcement. The codes of conduct would be governed by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, which oversees similar regimes in television and radio. They could finally give publishers and broadcasters the ability to bargain with Google and Facebook over the fair use of their content.</p><p>At the same time, the ACCC's final report backed away from some other measures that the media industry was hoping for. For example, an earlier suggestion that subscriptions to newspapers producing public interest journalism be tax deductible is now off the table.</p><p>The unmistakable vibe from Friday's proceedings is that the government is genuinely concerned about the power of big technology companies, and the impact that is having on consumers and parts of the economy.</p><p>From a media perspective, that is pleasing. Yet given recent events - raids on the home of a journalist and the offices of the public broadcaster among them - scepticism is still warranted.</p><p>Since the ACCC interim report was released in December, antagonism towards Big Tech has racheted up globally, particularly in the US. Washington is a bitterly divided place - about the only thing uniting the two sides of politics there at the moment is the need to act against the giants of Silicon Valley.</p><p>Senator Elizabeth Warren, a candidate for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, has been the chief protagonist on the political left, earlier this year unveiling a formal policy for Apple, Google, Facebook and Amazon to be broken apart on competition grounds.</p><p>Meanwhile, the powerful Department of Justice, which is under the purview of President Donald Trump, this week started its own investigation into internet platforms. It has the potential to be much more damaging to these companies than anything happening in Australia.</p><p>The US actually has a long history of splitting up its biggest companies. It stretches back more than a century, when Roosevelt, the last Republican from New York to occupy the White House, was in power. He gained a reputation as a \"trust-buster\" after taking on the dominant railroad and oil companies of that age. More recently, in the 1980s, under the staunchly pro-market Reagan administration, telecommunications behemoth AT&amp;T was torn apart.</p><p>We might well see history repeat itself. Facebook this week disclosed it had paid a $US5 billion ($7.1 billion) fine to the Federal Trade Commission, which is broadly analogous to the ACCC, for privacy breaches. The FTC then proceeded to announce its own, separate investigation into Facebook's market power.</p><p>The notion that the social media behemoth could be forced to divest its secondary platforms Instagram and/or WhatsApp no longer seems out of the question. Likewise, that the US tries to force Google to separate its search engine from its display advertising business, or that Apple or Amazon's wings are clipped also cannot be ruled out.</p><p>The Big Tech backlash is here. But Australia is no longer leading the charge.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520160217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WNC-3CD1-DY19-C2VS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"792\"/><timeReceived>04:02 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

A history lecturer at Exeter University, Terry is an expert on antisemitism and runs a blog examining Holocaust denial and its dissemination online.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You've got three separate phenomena converging,\" he says. \"One is the fake news stuff, promulgated by the likes of Facebook and Twitter, which is trying to promote specific false stories in real time for immediate impact; second, there's the ideological bubble - people only reading leftwing or rightwing news sites; and then there's this effort by fringe movements on Holocaust denial to make their websites look respectable and to hoodwink readers\u00a0into thinking what they're reading is OK.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A particularly specious example of the latter is martinlutherking.org, operated by the white supremacist group Stormfront. Another is the Journal of Historical Review which, despite its name, is a Holocaust denial journal. \"People think it is 'legitimate', which says more about the way they use Google to do research,\" Terry said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We at Facebook were far too slow to recognise how bad actors were abusing our platform</p><p>  Samidh Chakrabarti    </p><p>\"They are plucking facts out of a web page\u00a0that looks legitimate, but doing this so quickly they are genuinely surprised when they're told afterwards they've cited a denier website.\"</p><p>The challenges Terry faces in debunking myths, exposing lies and encouraging his students to question every click are now taking centre stage as a \"tech-lash\" mounts against the internet giants that a growing number accuse of having an excessive and unhealthy influence on our online lives.</p><p>Theresa May waded into the battle on Thursday, calling for investors to pull their funds from tech companies that fail to remove terrorist propaganda. \"Investors can make a big difference here by ensuring trust and safety issues are being properly considered, and I urge them to do so,\" May said.</p><p>Her comments came after Norfolk's chief constable, Simon Bailey, accused the firms of \"fundamentally enabling\" paedophiles to abuse children.</p><p>Facebook, aware of the turning tide, has been trying to get on the front foot when it comes to addressing such concerns.</p><p>In a rare corporate mea culpa, Samidh Chakrabarti, product manager, civic engagement at the social network, last week published a widely shared article that acknowledged: \"As unprecedented numbers of people channel their political energy through this medium, it's being used in unforeseen ways with societal repercussions that were never anticipated.\"</p><p>Addressing the role fake news played in the 2016 US election, Chakrabarti acknowledged that Russian posters had created 80,000 Facebook posts which had reached 126 million people in the US over a two-year period.</p><p>\"We at Facebook were far too slow to recognise how bad actors were abusing our platform. We're working diligently to neutralise these risks now.\"</p><p>Significantly, it's not just those who make or enforce the law who are at the vanguard of the tech-lash. Earlier this month, hedge fund Jana Partners LLC and the California State Teachers' Retirement System pension fund warned Apple that iPhone overuse could be hurting children's developing brains, an issue that, they said, threatened the company's long-term market value.</p><p>                     Marc Benioff, the billionaire chief executive of Salesforce, a customer relationship management company, has gone further, calling for firms that peddle \"addictive\" technology to be regulated like big tobacco. Otherwise, he warns, there will be toxic consequences, similar to those that followed the bursting of the credit bubble in 2008.</p><p>A large reason for the rise of populism on both sides of the Atlantic surrounds... issues around privacy</p><p>  Sir Martin Sorrell    </p><p>\"A decade ago you had the banks talking about collaterised debt obligations and credit default swaps, saying they were great for the economy, but regulators weren't paying attention,\" Benioff told a Davos audience last week. \"The government needs to come in and point 'True North'.\"</p><p>The credit bubble analogy is apposite. The anger trained on the banks following the credit crisis is migrating towards the largest tech firms, who stand accused of behaving like monopolies.</p><p>                     Sir Martin Sorrell, boss of the advertising giant WPP, warns that the forces that powered Donald Trump's election in America and the vote for Brexit stem partly from fears about the societal challenges posed by technology. \"A large reason for the rise of populism on both sides of the Atlantic surrounds... issues around privacy and certainly about jobs, and how the economy will develop at a time when technology is becoming increasingly important,\" he said.</p><p>It is a rare moment in history when politicians and chief executives are aligned.</p><p>\"The threat to the tech giants is coming from both worlds simultaneously, and the one feeds on, and takes support from, the other,\" said Barry Lynn, executive director of the Open Markets Institute, an organisation that raises awareness of the political and economic dangers of monopolies.</p><p>\"Benioff and Sorrell are not outliers,\" insisted Jonathan Taplin, director emeritus at the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California and author of Move Fast and Break Things: How Facebook, Google and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy. He points out that Facebook and Google took 88% of all new online advertising dollars last year. \"Internet monopolies distort markets and political systems,\" he added. This awareness seems set to make 2018 the year when it becomes apparent that big tech has become too big to defy gravity.</p><p>\"Perhaps we're at an inflection point where we stop getting more and more ecstatic about our tech champions and instead become realistic about the fact that they are for-profit companies like so many before them,\" said David Autor, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p><p>\"They create some great products, which is awesome. But their interests are not intrinsically civic-minded. I don't fault them for that. But it's the responsibility of government, competition policy regulators and attentive citizens to ensure that these important non-state actors have the incentive to behave ethically.\"</p><p>But how? Few back the nuclear option: a break-up similar to the pre-millennium attempt to separate Microsoft's Windows suite of applications from its Internet Explorer web browser.</p><p>An alternative is the anti-monopoly treatment meted out to US telecoms giant AT&amp;T, which in 1956 was forced to license its patents to rivals for free. The result was a technology explosion out of which emerged hundreds of innovative companies that became the first inhabitants of Silicon Valley.</p><p>\"Anti-monopoly enforcement leaves the basic services largely intact but actually limits the power of the monopolist in ways that eliminate the political dangers of concentrated power while improving the service that the customer will receive,\" Lynn said.</p><p>Such an approach would surely win favour with George Soros. \"They claim they are merely distributing information,\" the financier told a Davos audience last week. \"But the fact that they are near-monopoly distributors makes them public utilities, and should subject them to more stringent regulations aimed at preserving competition, innovation, and fair and open universal access.\"</p><p>In the US, where many of the tech giants are based, a Trump administration elected on the promise of tax cuts and deregulation is unlikely to have an appetite for such measures.</p><p>Europe sees things differently. The European Commission's decision last year to fine Google $2.4bn (\u00a32.14bn) for favouring its own services when consumers were using its search engine suggests an appetite for action.</p><p>The average teenager works two hours a day for [Facebook co-founder] Mark Zuckerberg, without getting paid a dime</p><p>  Jonathan Taplin    </p><p>But politicians and regulators risk falling out of step with consumers if they push too hard. Amazon customers may mourn the loss of their local bookshop but they still use its Prime service. Most Londoners don't want Uber banned from the capital.</p><p>And the services offered by the likes of Facebook are free, a fact that neuters one of the more potent charges against established monopolies - that they push up\u00a0prices.</p><p>In the current lacuna, a more practical approach to curbing the tech giants has started to emerge by focusing on what they prize most. Data is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence, the technology that allows the giants to anticipate our every whim and to sell us a new range of services we don't yet know we need. But few consumers appreciate its value.</p><p>\"Consumers are giving away valuable personal data for free,\" Taplin said. \"As they say, 'When the product seems free, you are the product'. The average teenager works two hours a day for [Facebook co-founder] Mark Zuckerberg, without getting paid a\u00a0dime.\"</p><p>The launch of European Union-wide data protection rules in May has already forced Facebook to \"protect free expression, keep people safe, and respect privacy\", according to the company's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg. The other giants will have to follow suit. A recalibration is\u00a0looming.</p><p>Germany is already threatening to ban Facebook from making access to its platform conditional on it being allowed to harvest unlimited amounts of user-generated data from third party websites. Facebook's response will reveal much about how it and, by proxy, the other giants, intend to resolve the inherent tension between their insatiable appetite for data and the consumer's desire for privacy. As they are forced to adjust their business models, others may spy opportunities.</p><p>\"People use Facebook because other people use Facebook,\" Autor said. \"Which means that if enough people decided that something else was better, Facebook could very quickly lose market share. Unrealistic? Perhaps. But think of Friendster, MySpace, AOL or Yahoo. These tech monopolies are often far more contestable than we assume.\"</p><p>Ultimately, the greatest threat to the tech giants isn't from politicians or regulators or rival corporations. It's from themselves.</p><p>                   Warning shots                   </p><p>\"Google, Apple and Amazon have created disruptive technologies that changed the world, and they deserve to be highly profitable and successful. But the opportunity to compete must remain open for new entrants and smaller competitors that want their chance to change the world again\" Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren</p><p>\"Social media companies deliberately engineer addiction to the services they provide. This can be very harmful, particularly for adolescents. There is a similarity between internet platforms and gambling companies\" George Soros, billionaire philanthropist</p><p>\"I don't have a kid but I have a nephew that I put some boundaries on. There are some things that I won't allow; I don't want them on a social network\" Tim Cook, Apple CEO</p><p>\"We have to take our democracy back. We cannot leave it to Facebook or Snapchat or anyone else. We have to take democracy back and renew it. Society is about people and not about technology\" Margrethe Vestager, Europe's commissioner for competition</p><p>\"God only knows what it's doing to our children's brains\" Sean Parker, Napster founder, on Facebook</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OBSRVR-40636553</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OBSRVR2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RHB-CC01-JCJY-G4P5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">143296</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1886\"/><timeReceived>12:05 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Guardian Newspapers Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Observer(London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"33188\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"01\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>January 28, 2018 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

The fifth-generation high-speed Internet will enable automated machinery for factories and remote monitoring of oil wells.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Saudi Telecom (STC) and Cisco have agreed to collaborate on the development of 5G communication systems and networks. \"Our new 5G network architecture will enable us to make the next leap forward by delivering inclusive broadband that transforms how people use technology in their daily lives,\" says Nasser Al Nasser, group CEO of the Saudi company. This \"will pave the way for massive innovation,\" he adds.</p><p>Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 reform program seeks to \"expand the variety of digital services to reduce delays and cut tedious bureaucracy.\" In 2016, the kingdom ranked 44th on the UN E-Government Development Index-which assesses a government's digital policies and ability to deliver essential services online-up from 90th in 2004.</p><p>Mobile operators, including STC in Saudi Arabia, Ooredoo in Qatar, and Etisalat in the UAE, are competing to be first to introduce a wide commercial 5G network in the region. The World Radio Conference in June will decide which spectra of 5G will be licensed in Europe, the US and the Middle East. The UAE plans to have its 5G network up and running in 2020, enabling the Internet of Things to gain momentum.</p><p>Early next year, Amazon Web Services (AWS) will open Cloud data centers in Bahrain, the first in the Middle East by a US provider. (China's Alibaba already has a Cloud region in Dubai.) Helping to seal the deal was Bahrain's agreement to build a solar farm to supply the AWS data centers with renewable energy.</p><p>Bahrain has been a financial center in the Middle East since the late 1970s, when banks were fleeing Beirut amid Lebanon's civil war. The small Gulf country, linked to Saudi Arabia by a causeway, is now aiming to be the region's fintech hub.</p><p>\"It is a landmark achievement for Bahrain to bring AWS to the region, because Cloud computing will position the country as a leader in enabling fintech services,\" says Sael Al Waary, chairman of Arab Financial Services (AFS) and deputy group CEO of Bank ABC.</p><p>\"The Central Bank of Bahrain has taken a very proactive approach in this regard,\" he continues. \"It issued a handbook on fintech and created a regulatory sandbox, a virtual space where financial institutions and other firms can test their solutions without the burden of existing regulations and licensing.\"</p><p>Bahrain's Economic Development Board is also actively facilitating fintech start-ups, he says. The investment-promotion agency-in partnership with FinTech Consortium, an incubator and ecosystem builder-recently launched Bahrain FinTech Bay, offering coworking spaces and shared infrastructure for corporate innovation labs and fintech start-ups.</p><p>\"While the new start-ups offer innovative products and services aimed at enriching the customer experience, agility and speed, banks offer trust, experience and funding solutions,\" Al Waary says. \"In order to grow in this ever-changing market, banks need to collaborate with fintech providers.\"</p><p>AFS, which is owned by 40 banks and financial institutions and is regulated by the central bank, offers innovative payment solutions. Earlier this year, Batelco and AFS launched bWallet, offering contactless payments and wallet-to-wallet transfers. \"The number of customers registering for the service is growing rapidly and demonstrates the market's readiness for more digital and cashless payment solutions,\" Al Waary says.</p><h>AMAZON, MEET RIVALS</h><p>Amazon will need computing power in the region following its purchase last year of online marketplace Souq.com, which is based in Dubai and serves seven countries in the region. A rival ecommerce firm, Noon.com, launched operations last September 30 with a $1 billion investment from Emaar Properties chairman Mohamed Alabbar of the UAE and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. Fetchr, another Dubai-based ecommerce company, uses the Cloud to help it deliver packages in a region with few street addresses by using mobile-phone GPS coordinates.</p><p>Meanwhile, Google parent Alphabet and Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company, are in talks to jointly build a technology hub in the kingdom. Google aims to expand its offerings in Saudi Arabia as part of a broader effort to create more digital content for the world's 420 million Arabic speakers.</p><p>The kingdom's central bank, the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, signed an agreement in February with US-based fintech Ripple for a pilot program designed to settle cross-border payments at lower cost using blockchain software. Last year, Al Rajhi Bank successfully completed a Ripple blockchain trial by transferring money between its branches in Saudi Arabia and Jordan. UAE Exchange, an Abu Dhabi-based remittance company, signed up to use the start-up's RippleNet product for cross-border payments. Countries in the Gulf have large numbers of migrant workers who routinely use such services to send money back home.</p><p>The technology boom, along with an easing of social restrictions in Saudi Arabia, is accelerating the pace of change. Careem, a ride-hailing company that is based in Dubai and popular throughout the Middle East, runs totally on AWS. Careem expects to have thousands of women trained to drive its cars in Saudi Arabia when the kingdom issues its first driver's licenses to females in June. Careem recently acquired RoundMenu, a restaurant listing and food-ordering platform. Last July, it purchased Swvl, which lets customers reserve seats on buses and pay their fares through a mobile app.</p><p>Dubai has issued its own cryptocurrency, called emCash, which works as part of the emirate's emWallet payment system. The UAE recently appointed a 27-year-old minister of artificial intelligence (AI), Omar bin Sultan Al Olama. He is responsible for promoting the adoption of AI technologies to improve the lives of citizens and to make the government more efficient.</p><p>In the Middle East and Africa, half of all mobile subscriptions are 3G. By the end of 2023, 90% of subscriptions in the region will be for mobile broadband, according to the Ericsson Mobility Report. It says the first 5G subscriptions in the region are expected from 2020, reaching around 17 million subscriptions by the end of 2023. Ericsson says a young and growing population with increasing digital skills will drive fast growth in broadband. Total mobile traffic for the region is forecast to grow by about 49% annually through 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Picture, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">First FinTech Conference in Bahrain, March 2017.

The vast reach of this video-sharing website ensured my message about the perils of the EU became mainstream and, in turn, helped to secure Brexit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Twitter gave rise to Donald Trump. His eye-catching tweets propelled this unorthodox businessman to the White House, despite him having no serious political experience whatsoever. And Facebook was instrumental in turning the Five Star Movement into Italy's biggest political party in just a few years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These three examples of antiestablishment triumph prove the supremacy of digital platforms today. Google is now the preferred gateway to information for most people, with 3.5 billion Google searches made in any 24-hour period. Similarly, almost 1.5 billion people log onto Facebook daily and in the same time frame 500 million tweets are sent.</p><p>It's easy to see why politicians and activists have taken to cyberspace so enthusiastically. Online, they can present ideas quickly and without fear of being edited. Individual viewers and readers can then choose who or what to support without influence from the biased liberal media.</p><p>The upshot of this, however, is that power now rests with just a handful of conglomerates. This has had some deeply troubling consequences. Free speech is under threat as never before.</p><p>The great irony of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Google dominating the information business is that the people who own and run these giant firms, and who facilitated these various recent political upsets, are ultra-liberal in every way. The collective horror they feel at having unleashed Trump or Brexit is palpable.</p><p>Consider Google's 2016 \"group hug\" video which came to light recently. It showed a private meeting of Google employees in which senior executive Ruth Porat appeared to cry over Trump's victory and told colleagues to cheer each other up by hugging.</p><p>More sinister is the digital censorship first observed in late 2016, straight after Trump's victory. The vehicles these tech companies created travelled in a direction which unnerved and angered the firms so much they began to tinker with the engines in an effort to alter their course. We know this thanks to the many examples of Twitter \"shadow banning\" that have surfaced, where a Twitter user's posts are made invisible to everybody but the account holder, limiting their audience without the user immediately realising it.</p><p>Similarly, in February 2018 it was reported that Trump's Facebook engagement had suddenly declined by 45 per cent. The reason was that, the month before, the site had introduced a new algorithm to its newsfeed.</p><p>Its chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, claimed this was intended to give greater emphasis to posts from friends and family rather than businesses and brands. Yet it is estimated that traffic to certain Right-of-centre sites and commentators driven by Facebook has fallen by 25 per cent or more.</p><p>Zuckerberg was unperturbed.</p><p>The terms of trade are clear: if they don't like you, they will erase you.</p><p>Left-wing online troublemakers, however, seem to have been immune from such suppression. I am not aware of any of the hard-Left Labour Party members accused of anti-Semitism having been censored or even investigated by the big tech firms, despite much of their deplorable activity taking place online.</p><p>What can be done? There are three options. Facebook calls itself \"a platform for all ideas\". It refuses to admit it is a publisher. It could be reclassified as a publisher so it is subject to regulation, just like a newspaper.</p><p>A second idea would be the break-up of the tech giants to deprive them of their monopolies. Or, a Bill of Rights could be established so that social media providers are forced to abide by guidelines.</p><p>I realise this goes against the idea of free market capitalism, but the digital tech firms represent something else altogether: the most extreme kind of global corporatism mankind has ever seen.</p><p>It is up to America, the home of these tech giants, to take a lead in addressing the situation. Once they do, the rest of the world can follow. Until this happens, I fear for our democratic future. This is the most important threat to free speech we face.</p><p>I have great hope that Donald Trump's campaign manager, Brad Parscale, understands the sheer size of the problem and I am increasingly optimistic that, in 2020, freedom of speech and stopping the bias of these big tech giants will become part of the Trump platform.</p><p>Nigel Farage is speaking today at the New Culture Forum, London follow Nigel Farage on Twitter @Nigel_Farage;

Many observers expected to be treated to a full schedule of oversight programming in the succeeding Congress, with a nearly endless stream of smug incompetents being caught in their lies and obfuscations. Some even dared to hope that the oversight fervor might spill over to another breed of smug incompetents: corporate CEOs. </p><p>But, alas, the promised enthusiasm for oversight never seemed to materialize, let alone spread to new targets. (As usual, House Financial Services Committee chairwoman Maxine Waters, who confronted big bank CEOs within months of assuming control of her committee, stands out as a rare exception). This general dearth of accountability made the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee's hearings last week with Big Tech CEOs all the more refreshing. Through incisive questioning, lawmakers were able to coax out consequential admissions of wrongdoing and bring to public attention the myriad harms these companies have perpetrated and then worked hard to obscure. Perhaps most critically, the information they uncovered and put into the public record lays a solid foundation for future legislative and executive action. Arguably just as important as the policy substance, however, is the fact that the hearings were engaging and frankly satisfying to watch. As they have grown more powerful, the Big Four tech firms have slipped further and further from the grip of democratic accountability. Like private governments, they have set rules that dictate the terms of the livelihoods, social engagements, and media consumption of billions of people around the globe. But as much as they like to pretend to be sovereigns, Big Tech companies are ultimately subject to the rules and regulations our government democratically (at least in theory) sets forth. It's good to see them reminded of that fact periodically. As inspiring as the hearings were, however, they were also frustrating, as they begged the question: Why stop with Big Tech? Although Silicon Valley giants may be the most widely-recognized examples of corporate power run amok, they are far from the only ones. In other words, last Wednesday's success can and should be widely replicated. The possibilities are endless, and potentially overwhelming. Given the current crisis, committees would be well-advised to start by challenging the corporate giants who have made the pandemic worse.As they have grown more powerful, the Big Four tech firms have slipped further and further from the grip of democratic accountability.That includes the private equity firms whose mismanagement of nursing home conglomerates left them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 outbreaks. In their heartless pursuit of profits, private equity firms loaded the nursing homes under their control with unsustainable debt, forcing them to cut staff, cut pay, and cut corners. Even before the pandemic, researchers documented how this led to worse outcomes and higher fatalities for patients in private equity-backed homes. And when COVID-19 hit, these facilities were particularly ill-prepared to respond. The House Ways and Means Committee should make the heads of these private equity firms\u2014behemoths like Carlyle Group, Blackstone, and Warburg Pincus\u2014answer for their actions. With jurisdiction over the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), which sets standards of care for nursing facilities, Ways and Means is well-positioned to not only get answers, but ensure that those answers lead to action. Many of these same private equity titans are long overdue for an appearance before the Energy and Commerce Committee as well. When they weren't snapping up nursing home chains, private equity firms were quietly constructing an empire of hospital chains. Just as with long-term care facilities, the aggressive pursuit of profit and mounds of debt left hospitals with little cushion to absorb unexpected blows. Sure enough, when the pandemic put lucrative elective surgeries on hold, some private equity-backed hospitals were quick to crumble. At least one leveraged its collapse into a bailout, holding healthcare amid a pandemic hostage in exchange for relief. Given these and other bad outcomes, it's time that Energy and Commerce put private equity CEOs under the microscope and consider the implications for the agencies under its jurisdiction like the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services. Meanwhile, the Education and Labor committee would do well to put another set of corporate villains\u2014meatpacking companies\u2014in the hot seat. Meatpacking plants quickly became coronavirus hotspots in the U.S. The experience in other countries shows that this was not just an inevitable function of poor working conditions, but a result of distinct choices from meatpacking companies and policymakers. Rather than working to protect their employees, meatpackers turned their attention to warding off health officials and regulation. That choice has had fatal consequences and they should be asked to account for it. A close examination of the breakdowns in the enforcement of occupational safety standards and the processes by which regulators are supposed to respond in an emergency, will also be a prerequisite to getting the response better next time. Moreover, meatpackers appear to have claimed shortages in product from their plants as a pretense to charge groceries more for beef and pork, which resulted in higher prices for consumers. Yet at the same time, these companies were shipping record amounts of meat abroad, suggesting that they were creating the shortages themselves, and pocketing the profits. The Education and Labor Committee could join Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ) and Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) in exploring that as well. Furthermore, to the extent that all of these industries are highly concentrated, the House Antitrust Subcommittee itself could haul in these corporate leaders to ask them about their businesses. Big Tech isn't the only industry requiring a second look through an antitrust lens. As the success of last week's hearing makes clear, House Democrats' choice to largely spurn corporate oversight has been a big missed opportunity. Confrontations with the country's ever more powerful corporate giants not only make for good policy but also good politics. If House Democrats are serious about either, they will fill the coming months with such clashes. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-CEPR120981159664744315425876100219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CEPR-120981</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HM-34C1-JCMN-Y3JB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299488</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1096\"/><timeReceived>5:10 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Center for Economic and Policy Research</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Blogs</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Op-Eds &amp;
