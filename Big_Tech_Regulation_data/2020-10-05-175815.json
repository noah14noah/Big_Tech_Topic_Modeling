The pandemic and modern politics have made clear that something is wrong with our information ecosystem. In Terms of Disservice: How Silicon Valley is Destructive by Design[1], Dipayan Ghosh points to Silicon Valley's business models, which direct the waves of personal data that flow across the internet, as an underlying issue. And Ghosh, co-director of the Digital Platforms &amp;#38; Democracy project at Harvard University who formerly worked at Facebook and the Obama White House, sees regulation of the industry as an inevitable solution. </p><p>\"People won't accept such invasion of privacy and damage to market competition in perpetuity,\" he said. \"Regulation is coming \u2014 and, I believe, it will ultimately impose the appropriate privacy and competition norms on the industry.\" Brookings Institution Press Excerpted from Terms of Disservice: How Silicon Valley is Destructive by Design by Dipayan Ghosh. Reprinted with permission by Brookings Institution Press. Is the fact that internet firms have overtaken the Western media ecosystem actually bad for our society? Perhaps it is for the best, in that it breaks the more traditional centralization of content creation?In fact, most of the appeal of social media originates from its capacity to connect us with issues and ideas that matter in our individual lives\u2014issues that would not appear on traditional media formats at all\u2014more so than the more abstracted concerns of the mainstream media.Whereas power among the producers of the traditional news media has waned, the power of the internet platforms \u2014 Google, Facebook, Twitter \u2014 has quietly emerged. A key part of their ongoing commercial strength lies in their 'first-mover advantage' in seizing the reins of the consumer internet business model, premised on the creation of advertising exchanges, at the same time as two technologies\u2014data storage and computing\u2014were rapidly expanding. Just as Google and Facebook settled on their advertising-based business models, these two technologies surpassed a key threshold that triggered the rise of the big-data economy; and as long as the internet companies could cling to its coattails, they would achieve great profitability.What has emerged, though, is a commercial regime underlying the entire open web that is algorithmically trained solely for the maximization of profit for the leading internet firms subject only to a few blunt constraints.On a near-continuous basis, algorithms are trained to understand the consumer's preferences, beliefs, and interests, all of which are shuffled into the consumer's behavioral profile; to keep the user engaged on the platform by understanding and ranking all content existing in the realm of posts that could be populated in the user's social feed; and to push digital advertisements that are likely to engage the typical user. In a sense, then, learning algorithms are continuously and ubiquitously used by internet firms to infer as accurately as possible the individual user's true nature and, accordingly, what arrangement of content should be pushed at the user to maximize profits. It is a fluid operation\u2014representing perhaps the most well-oiled machine the world has ever seen.This is what I call the radical 'commercialization of decisions,' radical because of its continual refinement and complete ubiquity across leading internet firms. All decisions made by learning algorithms in the context of the consumer internet are now necessarily commercialized in light of the combination of supercharged big-data technologies and platform power.That is to say, each decision made by a consumer internet learning algorithm\u2014be it over the determination of what content to push at the user, an inference of the user's character, or some other narrower practice\u2014is financially incentivized and therefore initiated and propelled purely by the pursuit of commercial gains; there is currency tied to every decision-making process that occurs in the industry, no matter how impactful or important it is.The consumer internet's vertical integration of boundless data collection and seamless logical integration of machine learning into every decision surface pertaining to every user and group of users is not discretized in the traditional hierarchical sense. This is the rhizome, as articulated by Gilles DeleuzeandFlix Guattari in their Capitalisme et Schizophrnie writings, at work. As with a rhizome, the ubiquitous commercialization of decision-making 'has no beginning or end; it is always in the middle, between things, interbeing, intermezzo.' No matter what data or currency may flow into or out from it, it has one governing, gravitational rule: profiteering.The consumer internet's rhizomatic culture is one of discriminatory decision-making everywhere, in every circumstance, all the time\u2014driven by the pure capitalistic energy of the Silicon Valley internet firm backed by the venture capitalists anticipating a barnburner buyout or initial public offering and the Wall Street executives hoping to cash in on any possible deal.This is a stunning distinction from prior times: the commercialization of decision-making has created novel opportunities to disseminate all kinds of speech\u2014whether organic, commercial, or otherwise nefarious in nature\u2014and inject it throughout the modern media universe. It has holistically diseased our long-standing traditions of independence and fairness.Individual capacity to determine what we see and are subjected to has been undermined and diminished by the consumer internet firms. Whereas the venue for information in decades past featured an open space for independent thought, it has now been invaded by a silent form of commercial speech; the content displayed before us comes at the beck and call of the firm responsible for populating the results page.Each time we open the laptop or check the phone and use the services central to information consumption, we are subjected to an array of information preselected and ordered for us at the determination of a mercenary machine, with nothing trained into its decision modeling except profit maximization. And as researchers Gordon Pennycook, Tyrone Cannon, and David Rand have found, 'even a single exposure [to fake-news headlines] increases subsequent perceptions of accuracy, both within the same session and after a week.' Such virulent consumption of presupposed conclusions within the filter seems to go hand in hand with related finding by Soroush Vosoughi, Deb Roy, and Sinan Aral that, based on analysis of rumor cascades from 2006 to 2017, fake news travels faster and further than the truth on Twitter.We have graduated from the formative 'public good' conceptualization of the World Wide Web at its inception. We are now in the age of the 'commercial good'\u2014that is, the good of the firms leading the industry.

Isn't that  great.</p><p> CORKE:  Fresh off yesterday's announced framework to improve trade with the  European Union, President Trump today looked to build on that momentum with  a trip to America's heartland.  Mr. Trump using a stop in Dubuque to calm  tariff concerns among Iowa farmers who collectively export a third of the  soybeans that they produce.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Basically we opened up Europe and it's going to be a great thing  for Europe and it's really going to be a great thing for us.  And it's  going to be a really great thing for our farmers because you have just  gotten yourself one big market that really essentially, wouldn't you say,  Kim, never existed because you just had -- you just had a problem.  </p><p> CORKE:  On Twitter Mr. Trump drilled down boasting that \"The E.U. would  start buy soybeans from our great farmers immediately.  His visit to Iowa  and later Illinois comes two days after Mr. Trump announced that his  administration would direct $12 billion to farmers who have been hurt by  tariffs, a plan critics called a bailout, a charge forcefully rejected by  White House officials.  </p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout -- this is  reciprocal.  Again -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where will it come from?  </p><p> MNUCHIN:  -- we want free and fair reciprocal trade and that's what we are  fighting for.  </p><p> CORKE:  However, the President's trade agenda has netted mixed results so  far.  Retaliatory tariffs have strained talks with both China and Canada  although there has been steady progress on a new trade deal with Mexico and  now a promising breakthrough with the E.U., the latter of which was met  with a cautious optimism on Capitol Hill.  </p><p> SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISINA:  When you negotiate, there's a chance  that you're not going to win but you can't make progress sometimes without  negotiating and I think that's where we are in the middle of.  </p><p> SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  Well, you know, any time that we  can sit down and start working through the differences, you know, that's --  everyone has a different style but if we can have the end result, we end up  with this fair trade -- I want free and fair trade.  </p><p> CORKE:  But progress is slow and that's particularly the case with  America's largest, single trading partner China, which has intentionally  targeted industries and crops in the Midwest with higher fees in  retaliation for new U.S. tariffs designed to level the trade playing field  -- a subject of great interest at today's Senate Appropriations Committee  hearing.  </p><p> ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  If your conclusion is that  China is taking over all of our technology and the future of our children - - it's a stupid (ph) fight, then you are right.  We should capitulate.  My  view is, that's how we got where we are.  I don't think it's a stupid  fight.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  Mike -- the U.S. has already slapped about $50 billion in tariffs  on Chinese products with the President threatening to slap another $200  billion on China if they don't back off on tariffs and obviously taking  advantage of our intellectual property -- Mike.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Something to watch there.  </p><p> Now, Kevin -- there's an important meeting taking place at the White House  tomorrow on election security -- what can you tell us about it?  </p><p> CORKE:  Yes, spot on.  The President will chair that meeting of his  national security team.  We are talking about Vice President Mike Pence,  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  And obviously John Bolton, his national  security advisor and others will be here to talk about the importance of  safety and security of our electoral system.</p><p> You heard Kirstjen Nielsen tell Fox News just yesterday, the Homeland  Security Secretary we recognize that Russia meddled in that 2016 campaign,  they possess the capability, Mike, to do it again in 2018 underscoring the  need for the big meeting here tomorrow -- Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  A huge story tomorrow and in the months ahead.</p><p> Kevin Corke, live at the White House.  Kevin -- many thanks.</p><p> Stocks were mixed as social media giant Facebook took a major hit today.   The Dow gained 113, the S&amp;P 500 was off seven, Nasdaq dropped 80.</p><p> Now, let's examine the short term and long term effects of the European  trade deal and the fall of Facebook on Wall Street today.</p><p> Deirdre Bolton of Fox Business Network joins us live from New York.  Good  evening -- Deirdre.  </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good evening -- Mike.</p><p> Well, Facebook's $119 billion plus route -- one of the single, biggest  losses in stock market history for any one stock -- is definitely  Facebook's worst day ever by far.  So the stock plunged at 19 percent; it  closed near that level.  So the company missed quarterly revenue forecast,  it lowered its outlook and it said its revenue growth rate will slow.</p><p> Some investors are worried that while Facebook's user growth is stalling,  it's spending more.  The company committed to investing billions of dollars  per year on developing stronger privacy measures.  The company has faced  bruising headlines about its role in enabling fake news and election  meddling so some see these decisions as necessary.</p><p> Optimists say Facebook has more than two billion global users, it will  figure out its next best steps.  One contextual point, the company's  previous worst single day performance, you have to go back to July 2012.   The stock fell more than 11.5 percent at that time.  The company and  pivoted to selling mobile advertising and investors doubted that strategy.   Now it makes up 91 percent of the company's ad revenue.</p><p> But no matter what the future holds, today's drop sent founder and CEO Mark  Zuckerberg's personal net worth plummeting by more than $11 billion --  Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Ok.  So that's something we'll be watching Deirdre.</p><p> But from the negative to the positive -- what are the short term and long  term effects of this European trade deal?</p><p> BOLTON:  So President Trump -- his meeting with the E.C. president Jean- Claude Juncker put a pause in an escalating trade war, so that's a bright  spot.  Europe says it's going to buy more American soybeans and more  American liquid natural gas.</p><p> Soybeans are the U.S.'s biggest agri export and buying with more from  Europe is going to counter what China is not buying.  If Europe buys more  American liquid natural gas, it could be a win-win for both regions.   Analysts say the U.S. could become the world's biggest supplier of liquid  natural gas in the next five years which would equal U.S. job creation.</p><p> For Europe the win is decreasing its dependence on Russia.  Russia has a 35  percent market share as a gas supplier in Europe and Russia is  unpredictable.  It cut off pipelines in Eastern Europe in 2006, again in  2007 and '08 and again in 2014 with harsh winter conditions.  There were  casualties.  Some experts say Russia uses its natural gas supply as a  weapon.</p><p> The business question though for American liquid natural gas suppliers is  that they can sell at higher prices in Asia because Chinese manufacturing  is on fire.  So those company heads will have some big decisions ahead. </p><p> Mike -- back to you.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Deirdre Bolton from Fox Business -- thanks very much.</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Republicans are going after Twitter tonight.  They say the social  media giant has purposely kept some of them from appearing in search  results.</p><p> Correspondent Peter Doocy reports on what some consider the latest example  of ideological censorship from the left.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Congressman Matt Gaetz is one of the  Republicans whose Twitter handle was hidden for months from some curious  users searching for him.  Type his name and he didn't pop up.</p><p> Today the President whose Twitter account helped get him elected wrote,  \"Twitter shadow-banning prominent Republicans -- not good.  We will look  into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many complaints.\"</p><p> Another one of the allegedly blocked Republicans RNC chair Ronna McDaniel.  </p><p> KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESWOMAN:  It took a tweet from the President of  the United States to get Twitter to care about every day Republican voters.   That's very troubling.</p><p> DOOCY:  The conservative shadow-ban appears to have been fixed this morning  for the first time since May when Twitter announced it would crackdown on  trolls contributing to an unhealthy dialogue and Twitter staffers explained  \"Some troll-like behavior is fun, good and humorous.  What we are talking  about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the  public conversation on Twitter particularly in communal areas like  conversations and search.\"</p><p> Those search bar changes aren't known to have impacted any Democrats.  The  spokesman for Donald Trump Jr. Andrew Sarabian claimed he was shadow- banned, too.  He tells Fox News, \"The targeted censorship of conservatives  on Twitter isn't some fringe conspiracy theory, it's actually happening.\"</p><p>Twitter insists \"Our behavioral ranking doesn't make judgments based on  political views or the substance of tweets.\"  Congressman Gaetz isn't so  sure.</p><p> REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I have been notified to have been shadow-banned -- myself, Mark Meadows,  Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.</p><p> DOOCY:  In 2017, a Twitter employee deactivated President Trump's account  because he didn't like his policies but it was live again 11 minutes later.  </p><p> These new accusations of bias may be probed for months.</p><p> GAETZ:  This is no different than if a billboard company were to make a  donation to my opponents and not the same donation to me, that would be an  illegal corporate contribution and we're reviewing our options to complain  to the Federal Elections Commission about the way Twitter has treated us.   </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DOOCY:  So much talk about social media here in Washington has been about  how the Russians used it to meddle in the last election.  But the alleged  interference being discussed today didn't originate at the Kremlin, it came  from California -- Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Peter Doocy reporting on Capitol Hill.  Peter -- thanks.</p><p> Conservative Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan wants to be the next speaker of  the house next year.  Jordan made the announcement last night and sent his  letter to colleagues today.  Jordan is a former chairman of the House  Freedom Caucus.  He faces likely competition from Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy and with Steve Scalise.  Current Speaker Paul Ryan is retiring at  the end of his term.</p><p>House Republicans are divided tonight over impeachment proceedings against  the number two official in the Justice Department.</p><p> Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge looks at both sides  tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Do I support impeachment of  Rod Rosenstein?  No, I do not.  </p><p> CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The House  Speaker characterized the articles of impeachment filed by the House  Freedom Caucus as an extreme step.  </p><p> RYAN:  I don't think we should be cavalier with this process or with this  term.  I don't think that this rises to the level of high crimes and  misdemeanors.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  Among the allegations: the deputy attorney general Rod  Rosenstein has a conflict of interest overseeing the Russia probe because  he signed the final surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter  Page based in part on the unverified Trump dossier.</p><p> Months earlier, the former British spy behind the dossier, Christopher  Steele, was fired by the FBI for lying.  Steele also admitted his hatred  for candidate Trump.  </p><p> According to the articles of impeachment, quote, \"Deputy attorney general  Rosenstein's failure to recuse himself in light of this inherent conflict  of interest constitutes dereliction of duty.\"  </p><p> GAETZ:  It was very frustrating to hear the speaker call our efforts  cavalier.  Christopher Steele lied to the FBI.  Rod Rosenstein knew that  and was so cavalier that he thought that his information was still a basis  to spy on people associated with the Trump campaign.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  Democrats claim the goal is discrediting special counsel Robert  Mueller's Russia probe.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Just when you think  you've seen it all, Republicans have no shame to go to a place where they  would undermine our judicial system.  </p><p> REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  If it's in the service of this  president, that's all they care about.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  A charge one key Republicans denies.  </p><p> REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), North Carolina:  I haven't discussed it with the  President and so I can tell you at this point who the President hires and  fires IS certainly not going to be influenced by something that this member  of congress does.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  In Boston the attorney general said house Republicans should  refocus and defended the department's number two.  </p><p> JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  My deputy, Rod Rosenstein, is highly  capable.  I have the highest confidence in him.  We need Congress to deal  with immigration questions.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  The Justice Department failed to provide the withheld records.   A Republican aide said tonight they have a commitment from leadership to  hold a vote on a contempt resolution after the recess in early September,  insisting impeachment remains on the table -- Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Catherine Herridge -- thanks very much.</p><p> HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p> EMANUEL:  The Associated Press is reporting documents from a London-based  investigative unit indicate the Moscow lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr.  and is said to have promised the presidential campaign -- the Trump  presidential campaign -- dirt on Hillary Clinton, worked more closely with  Russian government officials than she previously let on.</p><p> The AP says the documents are from a company run by a Russian opposition  figure.  The documents reportedly paint a picture of Natalia Veselnitskaya  as a well-connected attorney who served as a ghost writer for top Russian  government lawyers and received assistance from senior interior ministry  personnel.  She has previously denied acting as representative of Russian  authorities.</p><p> Today is the deadline for the Trump administration to reunite children and  parents separated at the southern border during its zero-tolerance  enforcement.</p><p> Correspondent Casey Stegall tells us where things stand tonight from  Dallas.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  More than a thousand reunions have  taken place and hundreds more have been approved ahead of today's deadline  to have all children back with their families after being separated at the  border.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I was sad.  It was hard because I  wasn't together with my papa.  </p><p> STEGALL:  The federal judge who set the deadline saying it appears the U.S.  government was on track to meet it, even calling its efforts to reunite  more than 2,500 total kids a quote, \"remarkable achievement\" though ACLU  lawyers claim federal authorities manipulated numbers in the government's  favor.  </p><p> LEE GELERNT:  There are many other people that will ultimately need to be  reunified.  So when they say they are going to meet the deadlines it's only  for those individuals they declared to be eligible for reunification by the  deadline.  </p><p> STEGALL:  He is referring to the more than 900 children that the government  puts into the ineligible category.  According to court documents, more than  450 involve a parent who has already been deported.  </p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  So these are parents  who have made the decision not to bring the children with them and then  will continue to work with the court to understand how we can best comply  with the order.  </p><p> STEGALL:  The ACLU and other immigration lawyers claim some of the people  left without their kids because they may have been misled by federal  officials.  </p><p> ROBERT LOPEZ, TEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT:  It's going to be difficult for  parents who are in a different country and, you know, may not know how to  navigate the OR, the Office of Refugee Resettlement System.  </p><p> STEGALL:  U.S. district judge Dana Sombra did admonish the Department of  Justice for separating families without a plan in place, saying it quote,  \"lacked forethought with regard to keeping track of people\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEGALL:  Both sides will be back in court tomorrow updating the judge on  final numbers and to provide a status update on its continued efforts,  despite the deadline then being officially up -- Mike.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Casey Stegall, live in Dallas on this important immigration  issue.

The big story there  tonight, a fast-moving wildfire believed to have been sparked by arson is  tearing through trees, has burned five homes and forced evacuation orders  for an entire mountain community.  About 3,200 people in Idyllwild and  nearby communities were ordered to leave their homes.  An estimated 600  structures are threatened.  This comes as California swelters under a heat  wave and battles ferocious fires at both ends of the state.</p><p> That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> EMANUEL:  President Trump is threatening sanctions against Turkey if it  does not free an American pastor detained for two years on terror and  espionage charges.  Just yesterday Turkey released Pastor Andrew Brunson  from jail but left him under house arrest.  The President made his threat  today over Twitter.  Vice President Mike Pence delivered the same message  during a speech last night.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  To President Erdogan and  the Turkish government, I have a message on behalf of the President of the  United States of America.  Released Pastor Andrew Brunson now or be  prepared to face the consequences.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Turkey has previously linked Brunson's return to the extradition  of a cleric it holds responsible for the failed July 2016 military coup.</p><p> The State Department is warning American companies they could face steep  fines or even criminal charges if their business involves North Korean  workers anywhere in their supply chain.</p><p> Tonight -- another potential thaw in relations with the Hermit Kingdom.</p><p> Here is senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Expected to be  returned as early as Friday, the 65th anniversary of the armistice that  ended the Korean War, the remains of 55 U.S. service members missing in  North Korea since that war.</p><p> A U.S. official tells Fox News it is anticipated the remains will be flown  from North Korea in wooden caskets on a U.S. military aircraft to a base in  the South.  </p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  We are at a better place than we  were six months ago.  I think the relationship, the dialogue, there is some  movement getting our hostages back, getting the servicemen back.  </p><p> PALKOT:  They will be catalogued and transferred to a center in Hawaii for  final DNA identification before being returned to families.  The return of  the remains was a major commitment made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  to President Trump last month in Singapore.  Some 5,300 U.S. service  members are still missing there.  </p><p>TRUMP:  The remains will be coming back.  They're going to start that  process immediately.  </p><p> PALKOT:  Earlier this week analysts said satellite photos indicated North  Korea was dismantling facilities at a missile test site.  With South Korean  President Moon, a new U.S. ambassador to South Korea, former Admiral Harry  Harris said the moves would be positive.</p><p> Still there's a lot of pressure on the Trump administration to deliver.   Secretary of State Pompeo's latest trip to Pyongyang came up short on  specifics from the North on getting rid of its nukes.  </p><p> OLIVIA ENOS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  We should view this as a positive step  but not necessarily overstate its benefits.  And you know, we still have to  watch and see what North Korea does when it comes to denuclearization.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PALKOT:  That U.S. official warned us when dealing with North Korea it's  not over until it's over.  After delays, at least for the sake of the  families of the service members involved, the hope is this time it's for  real -- Mike.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Greg Palkot -- thanks very much.</p><p> More fighting tonight between Israel and the Palestinians -- the Israeli  military says it intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza.  Yesterday Israeli  shelling of Hamas targets left three militants dead.  Today they were  remembered.</p><p> Correspondent Conor Powell shows us from Jerusalem.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CONOR POWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thousands of Palestinians in Gaza  gather today to mourn the death of three Hamas fighters killed by Israeli  tank fire.  Their deaths follow the shooting of an Israeli soldier  Wednesday.  Fighting has intensified along the Gaza security fence in  recent days despite both sides agreeing to a cease-fire in the wake of  months of weekly protests organized by Hamas in response to President  Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.</p><p> Palestinians are also demanding an end to the Israeli blockade around Gaza  -- with Hamas vowing to defend Palestinian people.</p><p> The weekly clashes have left more than 150 Palestinians dead and thousands  more injured.  In recent weeks, militants have launched flaming kites and  balloon to burn Israeli fields and properties.</p><p> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to continue targeting  Hamas until the rockets and burning kites stop.  </p><p> BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We will  do whatever it takes to protect the security not only of the community  surrounding Gaza but of the state of Israel.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> POWELL:  In the past the violence we're seeing around Gaza has often led to  a full-on war but despite the regular clashes it appears both Israel and  Hamas along with Egypt are trying to prevent the situation from escalating  further.  But that might be easier to say than to actually do -- Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Conor Powell from Jerusalem -- thanks very much.</p><p> Up next, the winners and losers from the President's trade and tariff  policy.</p><p> First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p> At least 216 people have died from coordinated attacks by ISIS on a  typically peaceful area of southern Syria.  Mass funerals were held today.   The area was the scene of several suicide bombings including one at a busy  vegetable market that left devastation and set in motion the coordinated  assaults.</p><p> Authorities in Poland have banned swimming at more than 50 Baltic Sea  beaches after hot weather led to the toxic growth of bacteria in the  unusually warm water.

Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us about a  new drug that might help slow the mental decline of Alzheimer's patients.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DR. KEITH FARGO, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION:  Potentially this is a  breakthrough drug.  </p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The long and discouraging medical  quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is looking promising  thanks to newly released results from a large-scale clinical trial.  Phase  two test results for a new drug known as a BAN2401 were rolled out at the  Alzheimer's Association international conference in Chicago yesterday, and  it's setting in the medical community abuzz with hope.  </p><p> FARGO:  There is a great feeling of progress happening in the field, and  everyone was very excited to hear the release of these results.  </p><p> TURNER:  Preliminary results show BAN2401 may have the ability to  successfully attack both changes to the brain brought about by the growth  of plaque and the symptoms it causes.  There is currently no effective  treatment for Alzheimer's aside from a couple of medications that slow down  memory decline for a period of months.  </p><p> But according to the Alzheimer's Association, the global urgency to better  treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is higher than  ever and growing.  This disease is devastating for Americans, 5.7 million  currently live with it, and by 2,050 this number will rise to 14 million.   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a national plan  to address Alzheimer's disease that seeks to find a treatment by 2,025.   BAN2401 may be the most hopeful piece of that puzzle.  </p><p> FARGO:  If this pans out in larger studies, this is what we would call a  disease modifying drug, which is something the field does not yet have.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TURNER:  Experts also caution there's still a very long road ahead and  probably years before BAN2401 gets approved for patients used.  The  Japanese company that developed the drug just recently submitted an FDA  request to initiate that approval process.  Until then someone in America  is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every 65 seconds.  Mike?</p><p> EMANUEL:  Gillian Turner reporting.  Gillian, thanks very much.</p><p> As Republicans accuse Twitter of shadow banning, we'll look at social media  politics.  The panel joins me when we come back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  When people search on Twitter for an account  that they might want to follow, typically those search results auto  complete or auto fill in.  But if people were searching for me or other  prominent conservatives in the Congress, our accounts weren't coming up.   That was not the same treatment given to Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and  others on the left.  </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA:  It sound like a coincidence, kind of  like when you disagree with President Putin you have a heart attack?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Senator Kennedy always has a good line.  Then there was quite the  moment on the Internet when you had President Trump go after Twitter come  on Twitter.  \"Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.  We  will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many  complaints.\"  </p><p> Can Twitter live to fight another day?  Let's bring in our panel, Byron  York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Mollie  Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Mo Elleithee, executive  director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics.  OK, Byron, what do you  make of was there some shadow banning going on on Twitter?  </p><p> BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  It  appears there was.  I don't think there's any doubt that these big tech  companies do lean left.  There was a report in \"Vice\" that I think made a  pretty good case that there was shadow banning going on against Ronna  McDaniel, Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz you just saw, and others.  This was part  of Twitter's plan to encourage a healthy conversation.  The problem is  Twitter gets to decide what is healthy.  So I don't think it's really a  surprise.  It's kind of a continuation of what we see, infringement of  speech on college campuses.  People leave college campuses, they go work  for Twitter, and this is continued.  So I think it was probably a good idea  for the president to point this out and give it prominence.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p> MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  He was wrong when he  said it was illegal.  I don't know if we have any actual law that can be  cited that's actually illegal, but it's definitely a problem.  Twitter and  other social media companies that are restricting speech.  If you care  about the culture of speech, you want to make sure you have this free flow  of ideas. </p><p> And I think conservatives have been complaining about this, not just the  issue that was mentioned in the report of when you search for a name you  can't find it, but actual downplaying of conservatives and hiding what  conservatives are tweeting.  You are seeing this across different social  media platforms.  It's partly because they built algorithms that have the  bias built into it.  They privilege certain types of communication and  punish other types of communication.  It's a very frustrating experience.   You see a lot of people who want to control the discourse in regular media  and social media, and it actually leads to a lot of frustration among the  average population.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Here's more from Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz about this very  issue.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I've been notified have been shadow banned, myself, Mark Meadows, Jim  Jordan, and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.  So I don't  know if that's the reason why we were supposedly inadvertently caught in  Twitters troll trap, but it seems very suspicious to me.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p> MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS:  First  I have to say as someone who works on a college campus that invites people  from both sides of the aisle, I couldn't let your comment about college  campuses go by without at least a subtle pushback.  </p><p> YORK:  I'll exclude yours.</p><p> ELLEITHEE:  I appreciate that.  </p><p> When Twitter announced back in May how they were going to go after  trolling, my initial thought when I read it is, OK, this is good.  Pushing  for more civil discourse on social media is a good thing.  Trying to push  back on those who are trying to disrupt conversation is a good thing.  But  I remember also thinking, they are going to get stuck here.  They're going  to catch the wrong people.  </p><p> And it seems that this is what is happening here.  The fact that Ronna  Romney McDaniel had this problem, but someone like an Alex Jones at Info  Wars didn't, that seems to be counterintuitive to what they are trying to  do.  Here's the problem.  These social media companies are trying to be  good citizens and encourage good debate and good conversation.  They are  trying to prevent themselves from being manipulated or being used as  organizing tools by hate groups or by foreign governments.  But at the same  time, they want to be platforms for free speech.  They are seeing it as a  challenge to do all of those things.  I applaud the effort for civil  discourse, but they have shown that they still have some work to do to  figure out how to do it right.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  OK, next issue, election security.  We expect a meeting tomorrow  at the White House.  Take a listen to this exchange.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  We have got  to make sure that we have the right kind of information sharing with  states, with secretaries of states, and with anybody else that could see a  cyber from Russia.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  House Republicans refuse to  act for any oversight, any founding, because they are now more concerned  about covering up President Trump's activities than defending our democracy  from foreign attack.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  So here we are three plus months away from the next election.   How alarmed should we be, Mo?  </p><p> ELLEITHEE:  I think we should be alarmed.  I think every independent  analyst that has looked at our elections systems from a nonpartisan  perspective keeps pointing to holes in the systems and areas where we are  vulnerable.  And I would love to see our federal government in a bipartisan  way step forward.  I don't think any administration has done what it needed  to do in recent times.  Step forward and figure out how to plug those  holes.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mollie?</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  The strength of our system is actually how decentralized it is,  though.  This is very much a local and state issue.  If people care about  it they should tackle it at the local level.  The more you centralize  election systems the more vulnerable they are and the more valuable those  hacks become.</p><p> ELLEITHEE:  You can give more support to the states, though, to do it.</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  And we have known about this for a long time.  We're having  warnings right now, but we've had warnings for four years or more about  China trying to do the same thing.  So we should be on guard against many  foreign entities.  </p><p> YORK:  This White House meeting, if only for the optics and P.R. of this,  they should have had this a long time ago.  The midterms are less than 100  days away, and we've had so many accusations that the Trump administration  has done nothing to try to stop Russian and other foreign meddling in these  upcoming elections when in fact some of these intelligence agencies  apparently have been working on this but they won't talk about it.  So some  sort of public sign that the president and the government are actually  doing something is really overdue.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Something I would like to get to quickly is the race for House  speaker for the next Congress is heating up.  Here we are about 100 days  out.  What do you make of it, Byron?  </p><p> YORK:  I think you are seeing with the entry of Jim Jordan in the race, I  think you're seeing the same dynamics that have driven Republicans in the  House crazy, the same dynamic that drove John Boehner crazy, and the same  dynamic that has drove Paul Ryan crazy is now showing up again, which is a  group of 40 or 50 really conservative Republicans disagreeing with the rest  of the party on a lot of key issues.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  I think it's just a healthy thing when you have races that are  contested and it helps you understand more about the caucus.  Kevin  McCarthy is the clear frontrunner.  You have a Freedom Caucus candidate who  has thrown his hat in the right, and you might see someone from the left  also enter the ring.  In general, I think these are healthy things.  You  get to learn more about what issues the Republican caucus cares about, and  that will help whoever is the eventual leader know how to manage the  caucus.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p> ELLEITHEE:  I think a lot of Democrats are excited to see this race between  McCarthy and Jordan play out.  A lot of it is going to depend on what  happens in November and whether this is a race for speaker or a race for  minority leader.  And if Democrats win back the House I will be curious to  see at what expense.  When Republicans won back the house it was at the  expense of a lot of moderate Democrats.  The caucus got then moved to the  left.  If Democrats win back the House, is it by defeating a lot of freedom  caucus type of candidates or more moderate candidates, and that will define  this race.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  All right, we have to leave it there.  Next up, the president  takes a victory lap after his trade deal.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have to say because we  have a lot of farmers in this place, we had this hat made up.  Look at  that, it's John Deere colors actually, but make our farmer great again.   Isn't that great?</p><p> These are incredible people, and you know we have given them a little help  yesterday.  We are giving them help.  And everybody is going to be back  because we have the greatest farms in the world.  </p><p> STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout.  This is a  reciprocal role -- again, we want free and fair reciprocal trade, and  that's what we're fighting for.  </p><p> To the extent people use political issues to target our farmers, the  president will stand up for them. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Some of the latest talk on trade, and tomorrow we've expecting  GDP numbers.  And the president gave us a heck of a tease.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will only get better.   Our numbers are fantastic right now.  You're going to see on Friday what  happens with GPD.  A lot of predictions, a lot of predictions.  I told you  before, some with a five in front of it.  There were predictions frm 3.8 to  5.3.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  It's 3.8 to 5.3, and we are back with our panel, Byron, Mollie,  and Mo.  Where are we, Byron, on the economy, on these tariffs?  </p><p> YORK:  I think the biggest economic news of the week could be coming  tomorrow.  Larry Kudlow came out and all but predicted economic growth for  the second quarter at four percent or higher.  And if you get four percent  economic growth, if you think the president has bragged about the economy  before, you just wait until there's actual four percent growth in the  economy.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  I also think the news we got yesterday about the E.U. moving  towards low tariffs or no tariffs with the U.S. is significant news.  We've  had so much criticism of the Trump administration's tariff policy.  People  say high tariffs are a really bad thing.  The Trump administration, not  just President Trump, but you saw this in last night's interview with  Wilbur Ross said the strategy is to get to low tariffs.  We've had this  post-World War II order that saw the ratcheting up of tariffs.  Partly that  was our desire to help a bunch of more ravaged countries after World War II  build up their economy.  They don't quite need that now.  Some of them are  powerhouses themselves.  So if you want to renegotiate this, you can't just  ask for it.  You actually have to threaten it.  That's the Trump  administration approach here, and their strategy might be paying off.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Here is the president talking about what he has worked out with  the E.U.  Take a listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We opened up Europe, and  that's going to be a great thing for Europe and it's really going to be a  great thing for us.  And it's going to be a really great thing for our  farmers because you have just got yourself one big market that really  essentially -- wouldn't you say it never existed, because you just had a  problem.  So we did that yesterday afternoon.  We signed a letter of  intent, or agreed to a letter of intent, and we are starting the documents,  but the relationship is very, very good.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  All right, Mo, so where are we on trade and tariffs?  </p><p> ELLEITHEE:  First of all, if I'm correct, the United States was already the  greatest exporter of soybeans to Europe, so saying that market wasn't there  before is a little off.  I will be curious to see what happens here.  It  feels like we have been here before where it wasn't that long ago that the  administration announced a major breakthrough with China when it came to  trade negotiations, and it was going to be great for us, and then it fell  apart.  </p><p> And what we've got is a commitment for a conversation.  I'm always for  conversation, I'm always for negotiation.  We'll see how that plays.  But  we haven't seen any details yet, we haven't seen any super strong  commitment yet.  And on a lot of goods, like steel and like aluminum, those  tariffs are still in place, and we see -- I know the package talked about  one anecdote with one company that was bringing back jobs, but there are  lots of anecdotes about companies that are still losing jobs as a result of  these tariffs and costs going up.  So I think we should encourage the  negotiations, but we are not there yet.  </p><p> HEMINGWAY:  One of the tweets that President Trump had earlier this week  that I thought was interesting is when he complained that people were  snipping at his heels and that it was difficult to negotiate when you have  all this criticism.  I took that to mean that he was trying to tell people  if you want to get to lower tariffs, you have to play the game here.  And  to have all this opposition and not figure out what the U.S. is trying to  do in taking on some huge structural problems with China but also with  other countries where you have regulatory barriers that prevent American  companies from selling their products in different places, or intellectual  property theft or really high tariffs.  </p><p> If you think the status quo is fine, you are opposed to the Trump  administration doing anything.  If you don't think the status quo is fine,  you should be thinking about how to help get to this eventual goal of the  Trump administration of lower tariffs.  They keep saying it.  Trump said it  in Canada, he'd like to move to no tariffs, no barriers.  If you are a free  marketer, if you like that, you should probably figure out what's going on  here.  </p><p> YORK:  The big news yesterday was not that they reach the agreement to get  there.  It was that they reached an agreement to stop going in the wrong  direction, which I think, just stop the threatening and the fighting is  probably a good idea.  Some of the tariffs are in place already and have  not been taken up.  But so much of this hysteria about this has been over  tariffs that were planned or threatened but are not in effect.  So if you  can just kind of stopped that and move, as Mollie said, toward a lower  tariff world, maybe Trump has had a good idea.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  I can tell you that a bunch of Republican heads nearly blew up  when there was talk about a $12 billion bailout to American farmers, so  we'll see where it goes from here.  </p><p> When we come back, an incredible success story about socks.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Finally tonight, a really feel-good story.  A lot of hard work  has paid off for a 22-year-old fine young man with Down syndrome.  The  socket company he founded alongside his dad is now worth $4 million.  After  just a year and a half, John's Crazy Socks has created 35 jobs and raise  around $135,000 for its charity partners.  John designs the socks himself  and fills the orders.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  John had worn crazy socks his whole life, that was his  thing.  </p><p> What's our mission?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our mission is to spread happiness.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  And John filled some pretty important borders.  Former president  George Herbert Walker Bush is a fan.  John has been exchanging socks with  Mr. Bush for the past year or so.  And I've got to tell you, I love the  story so much, I went on the website and I ordered some socks for myself  today.  I love a good pair of crazy sock, and you can see some of the  former president's fun socks there, Superman, and some other fun stuff.  </p><p> That's it for this edition of SPECIAL REPORT.  I'm Mike Emanuel in  Washington.  \"The Story\" with guest host Sandra Smith starts right now.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome to Washington.  I'm Mike Emanuel in for  Bret Baier.</p><p> President Trump is right now on his way back to Washington after two  Midwestern stops conveniently-timed for the day after he reached a major  agreement with Europe over trade and tariffs.  While the President is  assuring that better trade times are ahead, not everyone is so sure.</p><p> Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight from the White House.  Good  evening -- Kevin.</p><p> KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Evening -- Mike.</p><p> The President's tough trade tactics are working, say White House officials,  at least to bring our trading partners to the bargaining table.  But they  also quickly acknowledge that there is a fair amount of anxiety among some  companies and businesses that are afraid they will be caught in the  crossfire.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  -- there are a lot of  farmers in this place.  We had this hat made up.  Look at that.  It's the  John Deere colors actually.  Make our farmers great again.  Isn't that  great.</p><p> CORKE:  Fresh off yesterday's announced framework to improve trade with the  European Union, President Trump today looked to build on that momentum with  a trip to America's heartland.  Mr. Trump using a stop in Dubuque to calm  tariff concerns among Iowa farmers who collectively export a third of the  soybeans that they produce.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Basically we opened up Europe and it's going to be a great thing  for Europe and it's really going to be a great thing for us.  And it's  going to be a really great thing for our farmers because you have just  gotten yourself one big market that really essentially, wouldn't you say,  Kim, never existed because you just had -- you just had a problem.  </p><p> CORKE:  On Twitter Mr. Trump drilled down boasting that \"The E.U. would  start buy soybeans from our great farmers immediately.  His visit to Iowa  and later Illinois comes two days after Mr. Trump announced that his  administration would direct $12 billion to farmers who have been hurt by  tariffs, a plan critics called a bailout, a charge forcefully rejected by  White House officials.  </p><p> STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout -- this is  reciprocal.  Again -- </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where will it come from?  </p><p> MNUCHIN:  -- we want free and fair reciprocal trade and that's what we are  fighting for.  </p><p> CORKE:  However, the President's trade agenda has netted mixed results so  far.  Retaliatory tariffs have strained talks with both China and Canada  although there has been steady progress on a new trade deal with Mexico and  now a promising breakthrough with the E.U., the latter of which was met  with a cautious optimism on Capitol Hill.  </p><p> SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISINA:  When you negotiate, there's a chance  that you're not going to win but you can't make progress sometimes without  negotiating and I think that's where we are in the middle of.  </p><p> SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  Well, you know, any time that we  can sit down and start working through the differences, you know, that's --  everyone has a different style but if we can have the end result, we end up  with this fair trade -- I want free and fair trade.  </p><p> CORKE:  But progress is slow and that's particularly the case with  America's largest, single trading partner China, which has intentionally  targeted industries and crops in the Midwest with higher fees in  retaliation for new U.S. tariffs designed to level the trade playing field  -- a subject of great interest at today's Senate Appropriations Committee  hearing.  </p><p> ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  If your conclusion is that  China is taking over all of our technology and the future of our children - - it's a stupid (ph) fight, then you are right.  We should capitulate.  My  view is, that's how we got where we are.  I don't think it's a stupid  fight.</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CORKE:  Mike -- the U.S. has already slapped about $50 billion in tariffs  on Chinese products with the President threatening to slap another $200  billion on China if they don't back off on tariffs and obviously taking  advantage of our intellectual property -- Mike.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Something to watch there.  </p><p> Now, Kevin -- there's an important meeting taking place at the White House  tomorrow on election security -- what can you tell us about it?  </p><p> CORKE:  Yes, spot on.  The President will chair that meeting of his  national security team.  We are talking about Vice President Mike Pence,  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  And obviously John Bolton, his national  security advisor and others will be here to talk about the importance of  safety and security of our electoral system.</p><p> You heard Kirstjen Nielsen tell Fox News just yesterday, the Homeland  Security Secretary we recognize that Russia meddled in that 2016 campaign,  they possess the capability, Mike, to do it again in 2018 underscoring the  need for the big meeting here tomorrow -- Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  A huge story tomorrow and in the months ahead.</p><p> Kevin Corke, live at the White House.  Kevin -- many thanks.</p><p> Stocks were mixed as social media giant Facebook took a major hit today.   The Dow gained 113, the S&amp;P 500 was off seven, Nasdaq dropped 80.</p><p> Now, let's examine the short term and long term effects of the European  trade deal and the fall of Facebook on Wall Street today.</p><p> Deirdre Bolton of Fox Business Network joins us live from New York.  Good  evening -- Deirdre.  </p><p> DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good evening -- Mike.</p><p> Well, Facebook's $119 billion plus route -- one of the single, biggest  losses in stock market history for any one stock -- is definitely  Facebook's worst day ever by far.  So the stock plunged at 19 percent; it  closed near that level.  So the company missed quarterly revenue forecast,  it lowered its outlook and it said its revenue growth rate will slow.</p><p> Some investors are worried that while Facebook's user growth is stalling,  it's spending more.  The company committed to investing billions of dollars  per year on developing stronger privacy measures.  The company has faced  bruising headlines about its role in enabling fake news and election  meddling so some see these decisions as necessary.</p><p> Optimists say Facebook has more than two billion global users, it will  figure out its next best steps.  One contextual point, the company's  previous worst single day performance, you have to go back to July 2012.   The stock fell more than 11.5 percent at that time.  The company and  pivoted to selling mobile advertising and investors doubted that strategy.   Now it makes up 91 percent of the company's ad revenue.</p><p> But no matter what the future holds, today's drop sent founder and CEO Mark  Zuckerberg's personal net worth plummeting by more than $11 billion --  Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Ok.  So that's something we'll be watching Deirdre.</p><p> But from the negative to the positive -- what are the short term and long  term effects of this European trade deal?</p><p> BOLTON:  So President Trump -- his meeting with the E.C. president Jean- Claude Juncker put a pause in an escalating trade war, so that's a bright  spot.  Europe says it's going to buy more American soybeans and more  American liquid natural gas.</p><p> Soybeans are the U.S.'s biggest agri export and buying with more from  Europe is going to counter what China is not buying.  If Europe buys more  American liquid natural gas, it could be a win-win for both regions.   Analysts say the U.S. could become the world's biggest supplier of liquid  natural gas in the next five years which would equal U.S. job creation.</p><p> For Europe the win is decreasing its dependence on Russia.  Russia has a 35  percent market share as a gas supplier in Europe and Russia is  unpredictable.  It cut off pipelines in Eastern Europe in 2006, again in  2007 and '08 and again in 2014 with harsh winter conditions.  There were  casualties.  Some experts say Russia uses its natural gas supply as a  weapon.</p><p> The business question though for American liquid natural gas suppliers is  that they can sell at higher prices in Asia because Chinese manufacturing  is on fire.  So those company heads will have some big decisions ahead. </p><p> Mike -- back to you.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Deirdre Bolton from Fox Business -- thanks very much.</p><p> BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Republicans are going after Twitter tonight.  They say the social  media giant has purposely kept some of them from appearing in search  results.</p><p> Correspondent Peter Doocy reports on what some consider the latest example  of ideological censorship from the left.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Congressman Matt Gaetz is one of the  Republicans whose Twitter handle was hidden for months from some curious  users searching for him.  Type his name and he didn't pop up.</p><p> Today the President whose Twitter account helped get him elected wrote,  \"Twitter shadow-banning prominent Republicans -- not good.  We will look  into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many complaints.\"</p><p> Another one of the allegedly blocked Republicans RNC chair Ronna McDaniel.  </p><p> KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESWOMAN:  It took a tweet from the President of  the United States to get Twitter to care about every day Republican voters.   That's very troubling.</p><p> DOOCY:  The conservative shadow-ban appears to have been fixed this morning  for the first time since May when Twitter announced it would crackdown on  trolls contributing to an unhealthy dialogue and Twitter staffers explained  \"Some troll-like behavior is fun, good and humorous.  What we are talking  about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the  public conversation on Twitter particularly in communal areas like  conversations and search.\"</p><p> Those search bar changes aren't known to have impacted any Democrats.  The  spokesman for Donald Trump Jr. Andrew Sarabian claimed he was shadow- banned, too.  He tells Fox News, \"The targeted censorship of conservatives  on Twitter isn't some fringe conspiracy theory, it's actually happening.\"</p><p>Twitter insists \"Our behavioral ranking doesn't make judgments based on  political views or the substance of tweets.\"  Congressman Gaetz isn't so  sure.</p><p> REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I have been notified to have been shadow-banned -- myself, Mark Meadows,  Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.</p><p> DOOCY:  In 2017, a Twitter employee deactivated President Trump's account  because he didn't like his policies but it was live again 11 minutes later.  </p><p> These new accusations of bias may be probed for months.</p><p> GAETZ:  This is no different than if a billboard company were to make a  donation to my opponents and not the same donation to me, that would be an  illegal corporate contribution and we're reviewing our options to complain  to the Federal Elections Commission about the way Twitter has treated us.   </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DOOCY:  So much talk about social media here in Washington has been about  how the Russians used it to meddle in the last election.  But the alleged  interference being discussed today didn't originate at the Kremlin, it came  from California -- Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Peter Doocy reporting on Capitol Hill.  Peter -- thanks.</p><p> Conservative Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan wants to be the next speaker of  the house next year.  Jordan made the announcement last night and sent his  letter to colleagues today.  Jordan is a former chairman of the House  Freedom Caucus.  He faces likely competition from Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy and with Steve Scalise.  Current Speaker Paul Ryan is retiring at  the end of his term.</p><p>House Republicans are divided tonight over impeachment proceedings against  the number two official in the Justice Department.</p><p> Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge looks at both sides  tonight.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Do I support impeachment of  Rod Rosenstein?  No, I do not.  </p><p> CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The House  Speaker characterized the articles of impeachment filed by the House  Freedom Caucus as an extreme step.  </p><p> RYAN:  I don't think we should be cavalier with this process or with this  term.  I don't think that this rises to the level of high crimes and  misdemeanors.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  Among the allegations: the deputy attorney general Rod  Rosenstein has a conflict of interest overseeing the Russia probe because  he signed the final surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter  Page based in part on the unverified Trump dossier.</p><p> Months earlier, the former British spy behind the dossier, Christopher  Steele, was fired by the FBI for lying.  Steele also admitted his hatred  for candidate Trump.  </p><p> According to the articles of impeachment, quote, \"Deputy attorney general  Rosenstein's failure to recuse himself in light of this inherent conflict  of interest constitutes dereliction of duty.\"  </p><p> GAETZ:  It was very frustrating to hear the speaker call our efforts  cavalier.  Christopher Steele lied to the FBI.  Rod Rosenstein knew that  and was so cavalier that he thought that his information was still a basis  to spy on people associated with the Trump campaign.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  Democrats claim the goal is discrediting special counsel Robert  Mueller's Russia probe.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Just when you think  you've seen it all, Republicans have no shame to go to a place where they  would undermine our judicial system.  </p><p> REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  If it's in the service of this  president, that's all they care about.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  A charge one key Republicans denies.  </p><p> REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), North Carolina:  I haven't discussed it with the  President and so I can tell you at this point who the President hires and  fires IS certainly not going to be influenced by something that this member  of congress does.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  In Boston the attorney general said house Republicans should  refocus and defended the department's number two.  </p><p> JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  My deputy, Rod Rosenstein, is highly  capable.  I have the highest confidence in him.  We need Congress to deal  with immigration questions.  </p><p> HERRIDGE:  The Justice Department failed to provide the withheld records.   A Republican aide said tonight they have a commitment from leadership to  hold a vote on a contempt resolution after the recess in early September,  insisting impeachment remains on the table -- Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Catherine Herridge -- thanks very much.</p><p> HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p> EMANUEL:  The Associated Press is reporting documents from a London-based  investigative unit indicate the Moscow lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr.  and is said to have promised the presidential campaign -- the Trump  presidential campaign -- dirt on Hillary Clinton, worked more closely with  Russian government officials than she previously let on.</p><p> The AP says the documents are from a company run by a Russian opposition  figure.  The documents reportedly paint a picture of Natalia Veselnitskaya  as a well-connected attorney who served as a ghost writer for top Russian  government lawyers and received assistance from senior interior ministry  personnel.  She has previously denied acting as representative of Russian  authorities.</p><p> Today is the deadline for the Trump administration to reunite children and  parents separated at the southern border during its zero-tolerance  enforcement.</p><p> Correspondent Casey Stegall tells us where things stand tonight from  Dallas.</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  More than a thousand reunions have  taken place and hundreds more have been approved ahead of today's deadline  to have all children back with their families after being separated at the  border.  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I was sad.  It was hard because I  wasn't together with my papa.  </p><p> STEGALL:  The federal judge who set the deadline saying it appears the U.S.  government was on track to meet it, even calling its efforts to reunite  more than 2,500 total kids a quote, \"remarkable achievement\" though ACLU  lawyers claim federal authorities manipulated numbers in the government's  favor.  </p><p> LEE GELERNT:  There are many other people that will ultimately need to be  reunified.  So when they say they are going to meet the deadlines it's only  for those individuals they declared to be eligible for reunification by the  deadline.  </p><p> STEGALL:  He is referring to the more than 900 children that the government  puts into the ineligible category.  According to court documents, more than  450 involve a parent who has already been deported.  </p><p> KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  So these are parents  who have made the decision not to bring the children with them and then  will continue to work with the court to understand how we can best comply  with the order.  </p><p> STEGALL:  The ACLU and other immigration lawyers claim some of the people  left without their kids because they may have been misled by federal  officials.  </p><p> ROBERT LOPEZ, TEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT:  It's going to be difficult for  parents who are in a different country and, you know, may not know how to  navigate the OR, the Office of Refugee Resettlement System.  </p><p> STEGALL:  U.S. district judge Dana Sombra did admonish the Department of  Justice for separating families without a plan in place, saying it quote,  \"lacked forethought with regard to keeping track of people\".</p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> STEGALL:  Both sides will be back in court tomorrow updating the judge on  final numbers and to provide a status update on its continued efforts,  despite the deadline then being officially up -- Mike.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Casey Stegall, live in Dallas on this important immigration  issue.  Casey -- thanks a lot.</p><p> Up next, a major step in improving relations between the U.S. and North  Korea.</p><p> First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are  covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 35 in Orlando as the Walt Disney Company says it will stop providing  single-use plastic straws and plastic stirrers at all of its locations.   Disney officials say the policy will be in place by mid-2019 and as part of  the company's long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship.</p><p>Fox 2 in St. Louis as Missouri's second most populous county is the latest  municipality to sue opioid makers, distributors and pharmacies over what it  calls the worst man-made epidemic in modern medical history. </p><p> Jackson County says the epidemic has burdened the county with opioid- related hospitalizations, emergency medical responses to overdoses, babies  born in withdrawal, incarcerations and child welfare cases.</p><p> And this is a live look at Los Angeles from Fox 11.  The big story there  tonight, a fast-moving wildfire believed to have been sparked by arson is  tearing through trees, has burned five homes and forced evacuation orders  for an entire mountain community.  About 3,200 people in Idyllwild and  nearby communities were ordered to leave their homes.  An estimated 600  structures are threatened.  This comes as California swelters under a heat  wave and battles ferocious fires at both ends of the state.</p><p> That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> EMANUEL:  President Trump is threatening sanctions against Turkey if it  does not free an American pastor detained for two years on terror and  espionage charges.  Just yesterday Turkey released Pastor Andrew Brunson  from jail but left him under house arrest.  The President made his threat  today over Twitter.  Vice President Mike Pence delivered the same message  during a speech last night.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  To President Erdogan and  the Turkish government, I have a message on behalf of the President of the  United States of America.  Released Pastor Andrew Brunson now or be  prepared to face the consequences.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Turkey has previously linked Brunson's return to the extradition  of a cleric it holds responsible for the failed July 2016 military coup.</p><p> The State Department is warning American companies they could face steep  fines or even criminal charges if their business involves North Korean  workers anywhere in their supply chain.</p><p> Tonight -- another potential thaw in relations with the Hermit Kingdom.</p><p> Here is senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Expected to be  returned as early as Friday, the 65th anniversary of the armistice that  ended the Korean War, the remains of 55 U.S. service members missing in  North Korea since that war.</p><p> A U.S. official tells Fox News it is anticipated the remains will be flown  from North Korea in wooden caskets on a U.S. military aircraft to a base in  the South.  </p><p> JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  We are at a better place than we  were six months ago.  I think the relationship, the dialogue, there is some  movement getting our hostages back, getting the servicemen back.  </p><p> PALKOT:  They will be catalogued and transferred to a center in Hawaii for  final DNA identification before being returned to families.  The return of  the remains was a major commitment made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  to President Trump last month in Singapore.  Some 5,300 U.S. service  members are still missing there.  </p><p>TRUMP:  The remains will be coming back.  They're going to start that  process immediately.  </p><p> PALKOT:  Earlier this week analysts said satellite photos indicated North  Korea was dismantling facilities at a missile test site.  With South Korean  President Moon, a new U.S. ambassador to South Korea, former Admiral Harry  Harris said the moves would be positive.</p><p> Still there's a lot of pressure on the Trump administration to deliver.   Secretary of State Pompeo's latest trip to Pyongyang came up short on  specifics from the North on getting rid of its nukes.  </p><p> OLIVIA ENOS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  We should view this as a positive step  but not necessarily overstate its benefits.  And you know, we still have to  watch and see what North Korea does when it comes to denuclearization.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> PALKOT:  That U.S. official warned us when dealing with North Korea it's  not over until it's over.  After delays, at least for the sake of the  families of the service members involved, the hope is this time it's for  real -- Mike.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Greg Palkot -- thanks very much.</p><p> More fighting tonight between Israel and the Palestinians -- the Israeli  military says it intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza.  Yesterday Israeli  shelling of Hamas targets left three militants dead.  Today they were  remembered.</p><p> Correspondent Conor Powell shows us from Jerusalem.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> CONOR POWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thousands of Palestinians in Gaza  gather today to mourn the death of three Hamas fighters killed by Israeli  tank fire.  Their deaths follow the shooting of an Israeli soldier  Wednesday.  Fighting has intensified along the Gaza security fence in  recent days despite both sides agreeing to a cease-fire in the wake of  months of weekly protests organized by Hamas in response to President  Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.</p><p> Palestinians are also demanding an end to the Israeli blockade around Gaza  -- with Hamas vowing to defend Palestinian people.</p><p> The weekly clashes have left more than 150 Palestinians dead and thousands  more injured.  In recent weeks, militants have launched flaming kites and  balloon to burn Israeli fields and properties.</p><p> Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to continue targeting  Hamas until the rockets and burning kites stop.  </p><p> BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We will  do whatever it takes to protect the security not only of the community  surrounding Gaza but of the state of Israel.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> POWELL:  In the past the violence we're seeing around Gaza has often led to  a full-on war but despite the regular clashes it appears both Israel and  Hamas along with Egypt are trying to prevent the situation from escalating  further.  But that might be easier to say than to actually do -- Mike.</p><p> EMANUEL:  Conor Powell from Jerusalem -- thanks very much.</p><p> Up next, the winners and losers from the President's trade and tariff  policy.</p><p> First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p> At least 216 people have died from coordinated attacks by ISIS on a  typically peaceful area of southern Syria.  Mass funerals were held today.   The area was the scene of several suicide bombings including one at a busy  vegetable market that left devastation and set in motion the coordinated  assaults.</p><p> Authorities in Poland have banned swimming at more than 50 Baltic Sea  beaches after hot weather led to the toxic growth of bacteria in the  unusually warm water.  Regional sanitary officials have issued saying  contact with the bacteria may cause allergies and rashes.  Drinking  contaminated water can also lead to serious digestive problems.  Yuck.</p><p> The British government says doctors will now be able to legally prescribe  cannabis-based medicines.  The decision follows criticism over the denial  of medical treatment to severely epileptic children.  The government says  it has no plans to decriminalize the drug for recreational use.</p><p> Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.</p><p> We'll be right back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> CHRIS PRATT, MID CONTINENT NAIL CORPORATION:  We're in crisis mode.  Within  two weeks 50 percent of the orders that we had on the books were gone.  And  it keeps getting worse.</p><p> LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Mexican owned Mid Continent is  America's largest nail manufacturer and says they will close completely  without a tariff waiver, leaving 500 out of a job in Poplar Bluff,  Missouri.</p><p> As we walked about the factory floor, Philip Bennett toolbox grabbed our  attention.

CLAIRE MCCASKILL, (D) MISSOURI:  I want to save this company.</p><p> VITTERT:  Claire McCaskill spoke at a city committee hearing last month  about the company and is in a tight race for a third term from a state  President Trump won by 18 points.</p><p> PHILIP BENNETT, MID CONTINENT NAIL CORPORATION:  Claire came here and is  actually fighting for us.  I haven't seen the other guy do anything.  </p><p> VITTERT:  The other guy is 2018 Senate candidate, Republican attorney  general, and President Trump endorsee Josh Hawley.  </p><p> JOSH HAWLEY, (R) MISSOURI SENATE CANDIDATE:  I think they make a strong  case for an exclusion, but at the end of the day, we have got to get better  deals across the board.</p><p> VITTERT:  This aluminum is coming out at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit.  It  might as well be liquid gold for these workers.  Three hundred people hired  since the tariffs came in and helped bring this plant back that's been  closed for more than two years.</p><p> ROBERT PRUSAK, MAGNITUDE 7 METALS CEO:  President Trump gave us a chance to  fight on a level playing field with these tariffs.  We've take advantage of  that.  We're thankful to the administration for it happening.</p><p> VITTERT:   We caught up with the Cummins family of workers at Magnitude 7  Metals, three of the more than 300 workers hired.</p><p> All three of you supported President Trump?</p><p> DERRICK CUMMINS, MAGNITUDE 7 METALS EMPLOYEE:  Oh, yes, sir.  He kept his  word.  He's kept his word on everything he says as far as I'm concerned.  </p><p> VITTERT:  And they will listen to the president when it comes to supporting  Josh Hawley.  </p><p> In that New Madrid, Missouri, Leland Vittert, FOX News.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS HOST:  A federal appeals court has upheld a lower  court ruling blocking an Indiana mandate forcing women to undergo an  ultrasound at least 18 hours before having an abortion.  The ultrasound  waiting period law was signed by then Indiana governor Mike Pence in March  of 2016.  </p><p> There may be a glimmer of hope tonight for families dealing with a terrible  disease striking millions.  Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us about a  new drug that might help slow the mental decline of Alzheimer's patients.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> DR. KEITH FARGO, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION:  Potentially this is a  breakthrough drug.  </p><p> GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The long and discouraging medical  quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is looking promising  thanks to newly released results from a large-scale clinical trial.  Phase  two test results for a new drug known as a BAN2401 were rolled out at the  Alzheimer's Association international conference in Chicago yesterday, and  it's setting in the medical community abuzz with hope.  </p><p> FARGO:  There is a great feeling of progress happening in the field, and  everyone was very excited to hear the release of these results.  </p><p> TURNER:  Preliminary results show BAN2401 may have the ability to  successfully attack both changes to the brain brought about by the growth  of plaque and the symptoms it causes.  There is currently no effective  treatment for Alzheimer's aside from a couple of medications that slow down  memory decline for a period of months.  </p><p> But according to the Alzheimer's Association, the global urgency to better  treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is higher than  ever and growing.  This disease is devastating for Americans, 5.7 million  currently live with it, and by 2,050 this number will rise to 14 million.   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a national plan  to address Alzheimer's disease that seeks to find a treatment by 2,025.   BAN2401 may be the most hopeful piece of that puzzle.  </p><p> FARGO:  If this pans out in larger studies, this is what we would call a  disease modifying drug, which is something the field does not yet have.  </p><p> (END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p> TURNER:  Experts also caution there's still a very long road ahead and  probably years before BAN2401 gets approved for patients used.  The  Japanese company that developed the drug just recently submitted an FDA  request to initiate that approval process.  Until then someone in America  is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every 65 seconds.  Mike?</p><p> EMANUEL:  Gillian Turner reporting.  Gillian, thanks very much.</p><p> As Republicans accuse Twitter of shadow banning, we'll look at social media  politics.  The panel joins me when we come back.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  When people search on Twitter for an account  that they might want to follow, typically those search results auto  complete or auto fill in.  But if people were searching for me or other  prominent conservatives in the Congress, our accounts weren't coming up.   That was not the same treatment given to Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and  others on the left.  </p><p> SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA:  It sound like a coincidence, kind of  like when you disagree with President Putin you have a heart attack?</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Senator Kennedy always has a good line.  Then there was quite the  moment on the Internet when you had President Trump go after Twitter come  on Twitter.  \"Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.  We  will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many  complaints.\"  </p><p> Can Twitter live to fight another day?  Let's bring in our panel, Byron  York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Mollie  Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Mo Elleithee, executive  director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics.  OK, Byron, what do you  make of was there some shadow banning going on on Twitter?  </p><p> BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  It  appears there was.  I don't think there's any doubt that these big tech  companies do lean left.  There was a report in \"Vice\" that I think made a  pretty good case that there was shadow banning going on against Ronna  McDaniel, Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz you just saw, and others.  This was part  of Twitter's plan to encourage a healthy conversation.  The problem is  Twitter gets to decide what is healthy.  So I don't think it's really a  surprise.  It's kind of a continuation of what we see, infringement of  speech on college campuses.  People leave college campuses, they go work  for Twitter, and this is continued.  So I think it was probably a good idea  for the president to point this out and give it prominence.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p> MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  He was wrong when he  said it was illegal.  I don't know if we have any actual law that can be  cited that's actually illegal, but it's definitely a problem.  Twitter and  other social media companies that are restricting speech.  If you care  about the culture of speech, you want to make sure you have this free flow  of ideas. </p><p> And I think conservatives have been complaining about this, not just the  issue that was mentioned in the report of when you search for a name you  can't find it, but actual downplaying of conservatives and hiding what  conservatives are tweeting.  You are seeing this across different social  media platforms.  It's partly because they built algorithms that have the  bias built into it.  They privilege certain types of communication and  punish other types of communication.  It's a very frustrating experience.   You see a lot of people who want to control the discourse in regular media  and social media, and it actually leads to a lot of frustration among the  average population.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Here's more from Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz about this very  issue.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I've been notified have been shadow banned, myself, Mark Meadows, Jim  Jordan, and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.  So I don't  know if that's the reason why we were supposedly inadvertently caught in  Twitters troll trap, but it seems very suspicious to me.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p> MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS:  First  I have to say as someone who works on a college campus that invites people  from both sides of the aisle, I couldn't let your comment about college  campuses go by without at least a subtle pushback.  </p><p> YORK:  I'll exclude yours.</p><p> ELLEITHEE:  I appreciate that.  </p><p> When Twitter announced back in May how they were going to go after  trolling, my initial thought when I read it is, OK, this is good.  Pushing  for more civil discourse on social media is a good thing.  Trying to push  back on those who are trying to disrupt conversation is a good thing.  But  I remember also thinking, they are going to get stuck here.  They're going  to catch the wrong people.  </p><p> And it seems that this is what is happening here.  The fact that Ronna  Romney McDaniel had this problem, but someone like an Alex Jones at Info  Wars didn't, that seems to be counterintuitive to what they are trying to  do.  Here's the problem.  These social media companies are trying to be  good citizens and encourage good debate and good conversation.  They are  trying to prevent themselves from being manipulated or being used as  organizing tools by hate groups or by foreign governments.  But at the same  time, they want to be platforms for free speech.  They are seeing it as a  challenge to do all of those things.  I applaud the effort for civil  discourse, but they have shown that they still have some work to do to  figure out how to do it right.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  OK, next issue, election security.  We expect a meeting tomorrow  at the White House.  Take a listen to this exchange.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  We have got  to make sure that we have the right kind of information sharing with  states, with secretaries of states, and with anybody else that could see a  cyber from Russia.  </p><p> REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  House Republicans refuse to  act for any oversight, any founding, because they are now more concerned  about covering up President Trump's activities than defending our democracy  from foreign attack.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  So here we are three plus months away from the next election.   How alarmed should we be, Mo?  </p><p> ELLEITHEE:  I think we should be alarmed.  I think every independent  analyst that has looked at our elections systems from a nonpartisan  perspective keeps pointing to holes in the systems and areas where we are  vulnerable.  And I would love to see our federal government in a bipartisan  way step forward.  I don't think any administration has done what it needed  to do in recent times.  Step forward and figure out how to plug those  holes.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mollie?</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  The strength of our system is actually how decentralized it is,  though.  This is very much a local and state issue.  If people care about  it they should tackle it at the local level.  The more you centralize  election systems the more vulnerable they are and the more valuable those  hacks become.</p><p> ELLEITHEE:  You can give more support to the states, though, to do it.</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  And we have known about this for a long time.  We're having  warnings right now, but we've had warnings for four years or more about  China trying to do the same thing.  So we should be on guard against many  foreign entities.  </p><p> YORK:  This White House meeting, if only for the optics and P.R. of this,  they should have had this a long time ago.  The midterms are less than 100  days away, and we've had so many accusations that the Trump administration  has done nothing to try to stop Russian and other foreign meddling in these  upcoming elections when in fact some of these intelligence agencies  apparently have been working on this but they won't talk about it.  So some  sort of public sign that the president and the government are actually  doing something is really overdue.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Something I would like to get to quickly is the race for House  speaker for the next Congress is heating up.  Here we are about 100 days  out.  What do you make of it, Byron?  </p><p> YORK:  I think you are seeing with the entry of Jim Jordan in the race, I  think you're seeing the same dynamics that have driven Republicans in the  House crazy, the same dynamic that drove John Boehner crazy, and the same  dynamic that has drove Paul Ryan crazy is now showing up again, which is a  group of 40 or 50 really conservative Republicans disagreeing with the rest  of the party on a lot of key issues.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  I think it's just a healthy thing when you have races that are  contested and it helps you understand more about the caucus.  Kevin  McCarthy is the clear frontrunner.  You have a Freedom Caucus candidate who  has thrown his hat in the right, and you might see someone from the left  also enter the ring.  In general, I think these are healthy things.  You  get to learn more about what issues the Republican caucus cares about, and  that will help whoever is the eventual leader know how to manage the  caucus.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p> ELLEITHEE:  I think a lot of Democrats are excited to see this race between  McCarthy and Jordan play out.  A lot of it is going to depend on what  happens in November and whether this is a race for speaker or a race for  minority leader.  And if Democrats win back the House I will be curious to  see at what expense.  When Republicans won back the house it was at the  expense of a lot of moderate Democrats.  The caucus got then moved to the  left.  If Democrats win back the House, is it by defeating a lot of freedom  caucus type of candidates or more moderate candidates, and that will define  this race.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  All right, we have to leave it there.  Next up, the president  takes a victory lap after his trade deal.</p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have to say because we  have a lot of farmers in this place, we had this hat made up.  Look at  that, it's John Deere colors actually, but make our farmer great again.   Isn't that great?</p><p> These are incredible people, and you know we have given them a little help  yesterday.  We are giving them help.  And everybody is going to be back  because we have the greatest farms in the world.  </p><p> STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout.  This is a  reciprocal role -- again, we want free and fair reciprocal trade, and  that's what we're fighting for.  </p><p> To the extent people use political issues to target our farmers, the  president will stand up for them. </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Some of the latest talk on trade, and tomorrow we've expecting  GDP numbers.  And the president gave us a heck of a tease.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will only get better.   Our numbers are fantastic right now.  You're going to see on Friday what  happens with GPD.  A lot of predictions, a lot of predictions.  I told you  before, some with a five in front of it.  There were predictions frm 3.8 to  5.3.</p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  It's 3.8 to 5.3, and we are back with our panel, Byron, Mollie,  and Mo.  Where are we, Byron, on the economy, on these tariffs?  </p><p> YORK:  I think the biggest economic news of the week could be coming  tomorrow.  Larry Kudlow came out and all but predicted economic growth for  the second quarter at four percent or higher.  And if you get four percent  economic growth, if you think the president has bragged about the economy  before, you just wait until there's actual four percent growth in the  economy.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p> HEMINGWAY:  I also think the news we got yesterday about the E.U. moving  towards low tariffs or no tariffs with the U.S. is significant news.  We've  had so much criticism of the Trump administration's tariff policy.  People  say high tariffs are a really bad thing.  The Trump administration, not  just President Trump, but you saw this in last night's interview with  Wilbur Ross said the strategy is to get to low tariffs.  We've had this  post-World War II order that saw the ratcheting up of tariffs.  Partly that  was our desire to help a bunch of more ravaged countries after World War II  build up their economy.  They don't quite need that now.  Some of them are  powerhouses themselves.  So if you want to renegotiate this, you can't just  ask for it.  You actually have to threaten it.  That's the Trump  administration approach here, and their strategy might be paying off.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  Here is the president talking about what he has worked out with  the E.U.  Take a listen to this.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We opened up Europe, and  that's going to be a great thing for Europe and it's really going to be a  great thing for us.  And it's going to be a really great thing for our  farmers because you have just got yourself one big market that really  essentially -- wouldn't you say it never existed, because you just had a  problem.  So we did that yesterday afternoon.  We signed a letter of  intent, or agreed to a letter of intent, and we are starting the documents,  but the relationship is very, very good.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  All right, Mo, so where are we on trade and tariffs?  </p><p> ELLEITHEE:  First of all, if I'm correct, the United States was already the  greatest exporter of soybeans to Europe, so saying that market wasn't there  before is a little off.  I will be curious to see what happens here.  It  feels like we have been here before where it wasn't that long ago that the  administration announced a major breakthrough with China when it came to  trade negotiations, and it was going to be great for us, and then it fell  apart.  </p><p> And what we've got is a commitment for a conversation.  I'm always for  conversation, I'm always for negotiation.  We'll see how that plays.  But  we haven't seen any details yet, we haven't seen any super strong  commitment yet.  And on a lot of goods, like steel and like aluminum, those  tariffs are still in place, and we see -- I know the package talked about  one anecdote with one company that was bringing back jobs, but there are  lots of anecdotes about companies that are still losing jobs as a result of  these tariffs and costs going up.  So I think we should encourage the  negotiations, but we are not there yet.  </p><p> HEMINGWAY:  One of the tweets that President Trump had earlier this week  that I thought was interesting is when he complained that people were  snipping at his heels and that it was difficult to negotiate when you have  all this criticism.  I took that to mean that he was trying to tell people  if you want to get to lower tariffs, you have to play the game here.  And  to have all this opposition and not figure out what the U.S. is trying to  do in taking on some huge structural problems with China but also with  other countries where you have regulatory barriers that prevent American  companies from selling their products in different places, or intellectual  property theft or really high tariffs.  </p><p> If you think the status quo is fine, you are opposed to the Trump  administration doing anything.  If you don't think the status quo is fine,  you should be thinking about how to help get to this eventual goal of the  Trump administration of lower tariffs.  They keep saying it.  Trump said it  in Canada, he'd like to move to no tariffs, no barriers.  If you are a free  marketer, if you like that, you should probably figure out what's going on  here.  </p><p> YORK:  The big news yesterday was not that they reach the agreement to get  there.  It was that they reached an agreement to stop going in the wrong  direction, which I think, just stop the threatening and the fighting is  probably a good idea.  Some of the tariffs are in place already and have  not been taken up.  But so much of this hysteria about this has been over  tariffs that were planned or threatened but are not in effect.  So if you  can just kind of stopped that and move, as Mollie said, toward a lower  tariff world, maybe Trump has had a good idea.  </p><p> EMANUEL:  I can tell you that a bunch of Republican heads nearly blew up  when there was talk about a $12 billion bailout to American farmers, so  we'll see where it goes from here.  </p><p> When we come back, an incredible success story about socks.   </p><p> (COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p> EMANUEL:  Finally tonight, a really feel-good story.  A lot of hard work  has paid off for a 22-year-old fine young man with Down syndrome.  The  socket company he founded alongside his dad is now worth $4 million.  After  just a year and a half, John's Crazy Socks has created 35 jobs and raise  around $135,000 for its charity partners.  John designs the socks himself  and fills the orders.  </p><p> (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  John had worn crazy socks his whole life, that was his  thing.  </p><p> What's our mission?  </p><p> UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our mission is to spread happiness.  </p><p> (END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p> EMANUEL:  And John filled some pretty important borders.  Former president  George Herbert Walker Bush is a fan.  John has been exchanging socks with  Mr. Bush for the past year or so.  And I've got to tell you, I love the  story so much, I went on the website and I ordered some socks for myself  today.  I love a good pair of crazy sock, and you can see some of the  former president's fun socks there, Superman, and some other fun stuff.  </p><p> That's it for this edition of SPECIAL REPORT.  I'm Mike Emanuel in  Washington.  \"The Story\" with guest host Sandra Smith starts right now.</p><p> END</p><p> [Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Hey -- Mike.</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Hey Juan -- thanks so much.</p><p>WILLIAMS: You're welcome.</p><p>EMANUEL: President Trump takes a victory lap on his European trade deal in the heartland where he talks THE economy, jobs and tariffs.</p><p>Republicans go after Twitter for what they say is discriminatory and illegal censorship.</p><p>And a new reason for optimism in the search for a treatment for Alzheimer's disease.</p><p>This is a SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>EMANUEL: Good evening. Welcome to Washington. I'm Mike Emanuel in for Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump is right now on his way back to Washington after two Midwestern stops conveniently-timed for the day after he reached a major agreement with Europe over trade and tariffs. While the President is assuring that better trade times are ahead, not everyone is so sure.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight from the White House. Good evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Evening -- Mike.</p><p>The President's tough trade tactics are working, say White House officials, at least to bring our trading partners to the bargaining table. But they also quickly acknowledge that there is a fair amount of anxiety among some companies and businesses that are afraid they will be caught in the crossfire.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: -- there are a lot of farmers in this place. We had this hat made up. Look at that. It's the John Deere colors actually. Make our farmers great again. Isn't that great.</p><p>CORKE: Fresh off yesterday's announced framework to improve trade with the European Union, President Trump today looked to build on that momentum with a trip to America's heartland. Mr. Trump using a stop in Dubuque to calm tariff concerns among Iowa farmers who collectively export a third of the soybeans that they produce.</p><p>TRUMP: Basically we opened up Europe and it's going to be a great thing for Europe and it's really going to be a great thing for us. And it's going to be a really great thing for our farmers because you have just gotten yourself one big market that really essentially, wouldn't you say, Kim, never existed because you just had -- you just had a problem.</p><p>CORKE: On Twitter Mr. Trump drilled down boasting that \"The E.U. would start buy soybeans from our great farmers immediately. His visit to Iowa and later Illinois comes two days after Mr. Trump announced that his administration would direct $12 billion to farmers who have been hurt by tariffs, a plan critics called a bailout, a charge forcefully rejected by White House officials.</p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY: This is not a bailout -- this is reciprocal. Again --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Where will it come from?</p><p>MNUCHIN: -- we want free and fair reciprocal trade and that's what we are fighting for.</p><p>CORKE: However, the President's trade agenda has netted mixed results so far. Retaliatory tariffs have strained talks with both China and Canada although there has been steady progress on a new trade deal with Mexico and now a promising breakthrough with the E.U., the latter of which was met with a cautious optimism on Capitol Hill.</p><p>SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISINA: When you negotiate, there's a chance that you're not going to win but you can't make progress sometimes without negotiating and I think that's where we are in the middle of.</p><p>SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA: Well, you know, any time that we can sit down and start working through the differences, you know, that's -- everyone has a different style but if we can have the end result, we end up with this fair trade -- I want free and fair trade.</p><p>CORKE: But progress is slow and that's particularly the case with America's largest, single trading partner China, which has intentionally targeted industries and crops in the Midwest with higher fees in retaliation for new U.S. tariffs designed to level the trade playing field -- a subject of great interest at today's Senate Appropriations Committee hearing.</p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE: If your conclusion is that China is taking over all of our technology and the future of our children - - it's a stupid (ph) fight, then you are right. We should capitulate. My view is, that's how we got where we are. I don't think it's a stupid fight.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE: Mike -- the U.S. has already slapped about $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese products with the President threatening to slap another $200 billion on China if they don't back off on tariffs and obviously taking advantage of our intellectual property -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Something to watch there.</p><p>Now, Kevin -- there's an important meeting taking place at the White House tomorrow on election security -- what can you tell us about it?</p><p>CORKE: Yes, spot on. The President will chair that meeting of his national security team. We are talking about Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. And obviously John Bolton, his national security advisor and others will be here to talk about the importance of safety and security of our electoral system.</p><p>You heard Kirstjen Nielsen tell Fox News just yesterday, the Homeland Security Secretary we recognize that Russia meddled in that 2016 campaign, they possess the capability, Mike, to do it again in 2018 underscoring the need for the big meeting here tomorrow -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: A huge story tomorrow and in the months ahead.</p><p>Kevin Corke, live at the White House. Kevin -- many thanks.</p><p>Stocks were mixed as social media giant Facebook took a major hit today. The Dow gained 113, the S&amp;P 500 was off seven, Nasdaq dropped 80.</p><p>Now, let's examine the short term and long term effects of the European trade deal and the fall of Facebook on Wall Street today.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton of Fox Business Network joins us live from New York. Good evening -- Deirdre.</p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST: Good evening -- Mike.</p><p>Well, Facebook's $119 billion plus route -- one of the single, biggest losses in stock market history for any one stock -- is definitely Facebook's worst day ever by far. So the stock plunged at 19 percent; it closed near that level. So the company missed quarterly revenue forecast, it lowered its outlook and it said its revenue growth rate will slow.</p><p>Some investors are worried that while Facebook's user growth is stalling, it's spending more. The company committed to investing billions of dollars per year on developing stronger privacy measures. The company has faced bruising headlines about its role in enabling fake news and election meddling so some see these decisions as necessary.</p><p>Optimists say Facebook has more than two billion global users, it will figure out its next best steps. One contextual point, the company's previous worst single day performance, you have to go back to July 2012. The stock fell more than 11.5 percent at that time. The company and pivoted to selling mobile advertising and investors doubted that strategy. Now it makes up 91 percent of the company's ad revenue.</p><p>But no matter what the future holds, today's drop sent founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg's personal net worth plummeting by more than $11 billion -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Ok. So that's something we'll be watching Deirdre.</p><p>But from the negative to the positive -- what are the short term and long term effects of this European trade deal?</p><p>BOLTON: So President Trump -- his meeting with the E.C. president Jean- Claude Juncker put a pause in an escalating trade war, so that's a bright spot. Europe says it's going to buy more American soybeans and more American liquid natural gas.</p><p>Soybeans are the U.S.'s biggest agri export and buying with more from Europe is going to counter what China is not buying. If Europe buys more American liquid natural gas, it could be a win-win for both regions. Analysts say the U.S. could become the world's biggest supplier of liquid natural gas in the next five years which would equal U.S. job creation.</p><p>For Europe the win is decreasing its dependence on Russia. Russia has a 35 percent market share as a gas supplier in Europe and Russia is unpredictable. It cut off pipelines in Eastern Europe in 2006, again in 2007 and '08 and again in 2014 with harsh winter conditions. There were casualties. Some experts say Russia uses its natural gas supply as a weapon.</p><p>The business question though for American liquid natural gas suppliers is that they can sell at higher prices in Asia because Chinese manufacturing is on fire. So those company heads will have some big decisions ahead.</p><p>Mike -- back to you.</p><p>EMANUEL: Deirdre Bolton from Fox Business -- thanks very much.</p><p>BOLTON: Sure.</p><p>EMANUEL: Republicans are going after Twitter tonight. They say the social media giant has purposely kept some of them from appearing in search results.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy reports on what some consider the latest example of ideological censorship from the left.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Congressman Matt Gaetz is one of the Republicans whose Twitter handle was hidden for months from some curious users searching for him. Type his name and he didn't pop up.</p><p>Today the President whose Twitter account helped get him elected wrote, \"Twitter shadow-banning prominent Republicans -- not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.\"</p><p>Another one of the allegedly blocked Republicans RNC chair Ronna McDaniel.</p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESWOMAN: It took a tweet from the President of the United States to get Twitter to care about every day Republican voters. That's very troubling.</p><p>DOOCY: The conservative shadow-ban appears to have been fixed this morning for the first time since May when Twitter announced it would crackdown on trolls contributing to an unhealthy dialogue and Twitter staffers explained \"Some troll-like behavior is fun, good and humorous. What we are talking about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the public conversation on Twitter particularly in communal areas like conversations and search.\"</p><p>Those search bar changes aren't known to have impacted any Democrats. The spokesman for Donald Trump Jr. Andrew Sarabian claimed he was shadow- banned, too. He tells Fox News, \"The targeted censorship of conservatives on Twitter isn't some fringe conspiracy theory, it's actually happening.\"</p><p>Twitter insists \"Our behavioral ranking doesn't make judgments based on political views or the substance of tweets.\" Congressman Gaetz isn't so sure.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA: There are only four members of Congress that I have been notified to have been shadow-banned -- myself, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes. And the thing that we obviously all have in common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.</p><p>DOOCY: In 2017, a Twitter employee deactivated President Trump's account because he didn't like his policies but it was live again 11 minutes later.</p><p>These new accusations of bias may be probed for months.</p><p>GAETZ: This is no different than if a billboard company were to make a donation to my opponents and not the same donation to me, that would be an illegal corporate contribution and we're reviewing our options to complain to the Federal Elections Commission about the way Twitter has treated us.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY: So much talk about social media here in Washington has been about how the Russians used it to meddle in the last election. But the alleged interference being discussed today didn't originate at the Kremlin, it came from California -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Peter Doocy reporting on Capitol Hill. Peter -- thanks.</p><p>Conservative Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan wants to be the next speaker of the house next year. Jordan made the announcement last night and sent his letter to colleagues today. Jordan is a former chairman of the House Freedom Caucus. He faces likely competition from Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and with Steve Scalise. Current Speaker Paul Ryan is retiring at the end of his term.</p><p>House Republicans are divided tonight over impeachment proceedings against the number two official in the Justice Department.</p><p>Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge looks at both sides tonight.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE: Do I support impeachment of Rod Rosenstein? No, I do not.</p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT: The House Speaker characterized the articles of impeachment filed by the House Freedom Caucus as an extreme step.</p><p>RYAN: I don't think we should be cavalier with this process or with this term. I don't think that this rises to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Among the allegations: the deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein has a conflict of interest overseeing the Russia probe because he signed the final surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter Page based in part on the unverified Trump dossier.</p><p>Months earlier, the former British spy behind the dossier, Christopher Steele, was fired by the FBI for lying. Steele also admitted his hatred for candidate Trump.</p><p>According to the articles of impeachment, quote, \"Deputy attorney general Rosenstein's failure to recuse himself in light of this inherent conflict of interest constitutes dereliction of duty.\"</p><p>GAETZ: It was very frustrating to hear the speaker call our efforts cavalier. Christopher Steele lied to the FBI. Rod Rosenstein knew that and was so cavalier that he thought that his information was still a basis to spy on people associated with the Trump campaign.</p><p>HERRIDGE: Democrats claim the goal is discrediting special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: Just when you think you've seen it all, Republicans have no shame to go to a place where they would undermine our judicial system.</p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA: If it's in the service of this president, that's all they care about.</p><p>HERRIDGE: A charge one key Republicans denies.</p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), North Carolina: I haven't discussed it with the President and so I can tell you at this point who the President hires and fires IS certainly not going to be influenced by something that this member of congress does.</p><p>HERRIDGE: In Boston the attorney general said house Republicans should refocus and defended the department's number two.</p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: My deputy, Rod Rosenstein, is highly capable. I have the highest confidence in him. We need Congress to deal with immigration questions.</p><p>HERRIDGE: The Justice Department failed to provide the withheld records. A Republican aide said tonight they have a commitment from leadership to hold a vote on a contempt resolution after the recess in early September, insisting impeachment remains on the table -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Catherine Herridge -- thanks very much.</p><p>HERRIDGE: You're welcome.</p><p>EMANUEL: The Associated Press is reporting documents from a London-based investigative unit indicate the Moscow lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr. and is said to have promised the presidential campaign -- the Trump presidential campaign -- dirt on Hillary Clinton, worked more closely with Russian government officials than she previously let on.</p><p>The AP says the documents are from a company run by a Russian opposition figure. The documents reportedly paint a picture of Natalia Veselnitskaya as a well-connected attorney who served as a ghost writer for top Russian government lawyers and received assistance from senior interior ministry personnel. She has previously denied acting as representative of Russian authorities.</p><p>Today is the deadline for the Trump administration to reunite children and parents separated at the southern border during its zero-tolerance enforcement.</p><p>Correspondent Casey Stegall tells us where things stand tonight from Dallas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: More than a thousand reunions have taken place and hundreds more have been approved ahead of today's deadline to have all children back with their families after being separated at the border.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator): I was sad. It was hard because I wasn't together with my papa.</p><p>STEGALL: The federal judge who set the deadline saying it appears the U.S. government was on track to meet it, even calling its efforts to reunite more than 2,500 total kids a quote, \"remarkable achievement\" though ACLU lawyers claim federal authorities manipulated numbers in the government's favor.</p><p>LEE GELERNT: There are many other people that will ultimately need to be reunified. So when they say they are going to meet the deadlines it's only for those individuals they declared to be eligible for reunification by the deadline.</p><p>STEGALL: He is referring to the more than 900 children that the government puts into the ineligible category. According to court documents, more than 450 involve a parent who has already been deported.</p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY: So these are parents who have made the decision not to bring the children with them and then will continue to work with the court to understand how we can best comply with the order.</p><p>STEGALL: The ACLU and other immigration lawyers claim some of the people left without their kids because they may have been misled by federal officials.</p><p>ROBERT LOPEZ, TEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT: It's going to be difficult for parents who are in a different country and, you know, may not know how to navigate the OR, the Office of Refugee Resettlement System.</p><p>STEGALL: U.S. district judge Dana Sombra did admonish the Department of Justice for separating families without a plan in place, saying it quote, \"lacked forethought with regard to keeping track of people\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEGALL: Both sides will be back in court tomorrow updating the judge on final numbers and to provide a status update on its continued efforts, despite the deadline then being officially up -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Casey Stegall, live in Dallas on this important immigration issue. Casey -- thanks a lot.</p><p>Up next, a major step in improving relations between the U.S. and North Korea.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 35 in Orlando as the Walt Disney Company says it will stop providing single-use plastic straws and plastic stirrers at all of its locations. Disney officials say the policy will be in place by mid-2019 and as part of the company's long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship.</p><p>Fox 2 in St. Louis as Missouri's second most populous county is the latest municipality to sue opioid makers, distributors and pharmacies over what it calls the worst man-made epidemic in modern medical history.</p><p>Jackson County says the epidemic has burdened the county with opioid- related hospitalizations, emergency medical responses to overdoses, babies born in withdrawal, incarcerations and child welfare cases.</p><p>And this is a live look at Los Angeles from Fox 11. The big story there tonight, a fast-moving wildfire believed to have been sparked by arson is tearing through trees, has burned five homes and forced evacuation orders for an entire mountain community. About 3,200 people in Idyllwild and nearby communities were ordered to leave their homes. An estimated 600 structures are threatened. This comes as California swelters under a heat wave and battles ferocious fires at both ends of the state.</p><p>That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>EMANUEL: President Trump is threatening sanctions against Turkey if it does not free an American pastor detained for two years on terror and espionage charges. Just yesterday Turkey released Pastor Andrew Brunson from jail but left him under house arrest. The President made his threat today over Twitter. Vice President Mike Pence delivered the same message during a speech last night.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To President Erdogan and the Turkish government, I have a message on behalf of the President of the United States of America. Released Pastor Andrew Brunson now or be prepared to face the consequences.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Turkey has previously linked Brunson's return to the extradition of a cleric it holds responsible for the failed July 2016 military coup.</p><p>The State Department is warning American companies they could face steep fines or even criminal charges if their business involves North Korean workers anywhere in their supply chain.</p><p>Tonight -- another potential thaw in relations with the Hermit Kingdom.</p><p>Here is senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT: Expected to be returned as early as Friday, the 65th anniversary of the armistice that ended the Korean War, the remains of 55 U.S. service members missing in North Korea since that war.</p><p>A U.S. official tells Fox News it is anticipated the remains will be flown from North Korea in wooden caskets on a U.S. military aircraft to a base in the South.</p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: We are at a better place than we were six months ago. I think the relationship, the dialogue, there is some movement getting our hostages back, getting the servicemen back.</p><p>PALKOT: They will be catalogued and transferred to a center in Hawaii for final DNA identification before being returned to families. The return of the remains was a major commitment made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un to President Trump last month in Singapore. Some 5,300 U.S. service members are still missing there.</p><p>TRUMP: The remains will be coming back. They're going to start that process immediately.</p><p>PALKOT: Earlier this week analysts said satellite photos indicated North Korea was dismantling facilities at a missile test site. With South Korean President Moon, a new U.S. ambassador to South Korea, former Admiral Harry Harris said the moves would be positive.</p><p>Still there's a lot of pressure on the Trump administration to deliver. Secretary of State Pompeo's latest trip to Pyongyang came up short on specifics from the North on getting rid of its nukes.</p><p>OLIVIA ENOS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION: We should view this as a positive step but not necessarily overstate its benefits. And you know, we still have to watch and see what North Korea does when it comes to denuclearization.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PALKOT: That U.S. official warned us when dealing with North Korea it's not over until it's over. After delays, at least for the sake of the families of the service members involved, the hope is this time it's for real -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Greg Palkot -- thanks very much.</p><p>More fighting tonight between Israel and the Palestinians -- the Israeli military says it intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza. Yesterday Israeli shelling of Hamas targets left three militants dead. Today they were remembered.</p><p>Correspondent Conor Powell shows us from Jerusalem.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CONOR POWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Thousands of Palestinians in Gaza gather today to mourn the death of three Hamas fighters killed by Israeli tank fire. Their deaths follow the shooting of an Israeli soldier Wednesday. Fighting has intensified along the Gaza security fence in recent days despite both sides agreeing to a cease-fire in the wake of months of weekly protests organized by Hamas in response to President Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.</p><p>Palestinians are also demanding an end to the Israeli blockade around Gaza -- with Hamas vowing to defend Palestinian people.</p><p>The weekly clashes have left more than 150 Palestinians dead and thousands more injured. In recent weeks, militants have launched flaming kites and balloon to burn Israeli fields and properties.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to continue targeting Hamas until the rockets and burning kites stop.</p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator): We will do whatever it takes to protect the security not only of the community surrounding Gaza but of the state of Israel.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POWELL: In the past the violence we're seeing around Gaza has often led to a full-on war but despite the regular clashes it appears both Israel and Hamas along with Egypt are trying to prevent the situation from escalating further. But that might be easier to say than to actually do -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL: Conor Powell from Jerusalem -- thanks very much.</p><p>Up next, the winners and losers from the President's trade and tariff policy.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>At least 216 people have died from coordinated attacks by ISIS on a typically peaceful area of southern Syria. Mass funerals were held today. The area was the scene of several suicide bombings including one at a busy vegetable market that left devastation and set in motion the coordinated assaults.</p><p>Authorities in Poland have banned swimming at more than 50 Baltic Sea beaches after hot weather led to the toxic growth of bacteria in the unusually warm water. Regional sanitary officials have issued saying contact with the bacteria may cause allergies and rashes. Drinking contaminated water can also lead to serious digestive problems. Yuck.</p><p>The British government says doctors will now be able to legally prescribe cannabis-based medicines. The decision follows criticism over the denial of medical treatment to severely epileptic children. The government says it has no plans to decriminalize the drug for recreational use.</p><p>Just some of the other stories beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>CHRIS PRATT, MID CONTINENT NAIL CORPORATION: We're in crisis mode. Within two weeks 50 percent of the orders that we had on the books were gone. And it keeps getting worse.</p><p>LELAND VITTERT, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: Mexican owned Mid Continent is America's largest nail manufacturer and says they will close completely without a tariff waiver, leaving 500 out of a job in Poplar Bluff, Missouri.</p><p>As we walked about the factory floor, Philip Bennett toolbox grabbed our attention.

CLAIRE MCCASKILL, (D) MISSOURI: I want to save this company.</p><p>VITTERT: Claire McCaskill spoke at a city committee hearing last month about the company and is in a tight race for a third term from a state President Trump won by 18 points.</p><p>PHILIP BENNETT, MID CONTINENT NAIL CORPORATION: Claire came here and is actually fighting for us. I haven't seen the other guy do anything.</p><p>VITTERT: The other guy is 2018 Senate candidate, Republican attorney general, and President Trump endorsee Josh Hawley.</p><p>JOSH HAWLEY, (R) MISSOURI SENATE CANDIDATE: I think they make a strong case for an exclusion, but at the end of the day, we have got to get better deals across the board.</p><p>VITTERT: This aluminum is coming out at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. It might as well be liquid gold for these workers. Three hundred people hired since the tariffs came in and helped bring this plant back that's been closed for more than two years.</p><p>ROBERT PRUSAK, MAGNITUDE 7 METALS CEO: President Trump gave us a chance to fight on a level playing field with these tariffs. We've take advantage of that. We're thankful to the administration for it happening.</p><p>VITTERT: We caught up with the Cummins family of workers at Magnitude 7 Metals, three of the more than 300 workers hired.</p><p>All three of you supported President Trump?</p><p>DERRICK CUMMINS, MAGNITUDE 7 METALS EMPLOYEE: Oh, yes, sir. He kept his word. He's kept his word on everything he says as far as I'm concerned.</p><p>VITTERT: And they will listen to the president when it comes to supporting Josh Hawley.</p><p>In that New Madrid, Missouri, Leland Vittert, FOX News.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS HOST: A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court ruling blocking an Indiana mandate forcing women to undergo an ultrasound at least 18 hours before having an abortion. The ultrasound waiting period law was signed by then Indiana governor Mike Pence in March of 2016.</p><p>There may be a glimmer of hope tonight for families dealing with a terrible disease striking millions. Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us about a new drug that might help slow the mental decline of Alzheimer's patients.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. KEITH FARGO, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION: Potentially this is a breakthrough drug.</p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: The long and discouraging medical quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is looking promising thanks to newly released results from a large-scale clinical trial. Phase two test results for a new drug known as a BAN2401 were rolled out at the Alzheimer's Association international conference in Chicago yesterday, and it's setting in the medical community abuzz with hope.</p><p>FARGO: There is a great feeling of progress happening in the field, and everyone was very excited to hear the release of these results.</p><p>TURNER: Preliminary results show BAN2401 may have the ability to successfully attack both changes to the brain brought about by the growth of plaque and the symptoms it causes. There is currently no effective treatment for Alzheimer's aside from a couple of medications that slow down memory decline for a period of months.</p><p>But according to the Alzheimer's Association, the global urgency to better treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is higher than ever and growing. This disease is devastating for Americans, 5.7 million currently live with it, and by 2,050 this number will rise to 14 million. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a national plan to address Alzheimer's disease that seeks to find a treatment by 2,025. BAN2401 may be the most hopeful piece of that puzzle.</p><p>FARGO: If this pans out in larger studies, this is what we would call a disease modifying drug, which is something the field does not yet have.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER: Experts also caution there's still a very long road ahead and probably years before BAN2401 gets approved for patients used. The Japanese company that developed the drug just recently submitted an FDA request to initiate that approval process. Until then someone in America is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every 65 seconds. Mike?</p><p>EMANUEL: Gillian Turner reporting. Gillian, thanks very much.</p><p>As Republicans accuse Twitter of shadow banning, we'll look at social media politics. The panel joins me when we come back.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA: When people search on Twitter for an account that they might want to follow, typically those search results auto complete or auto fill in. But if people were searching for me or other prominent conservatives in the Congress, our accounts weren't coming up. That was not the same treatment given to Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and others on the left.</p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA: It sound like a coincidence, kind of like when you disagree with President Putin you have a heart attack?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Senator Kennedy always has a good line. Then there was quite the moment on the Internet when you had President Trump go after Twitter come on Twitter. \"Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good. We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.\"</p><p>Can Twitter live to fight another day? Let's bring in our panel, Byron York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Mollie Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Mo Elleithee, executive director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics. OK, Byron, what do you make of was there some shadow banning going on on Twitter?</p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\": It appears there was. I don't think there's any doubt that these big tech companies do lean left. There was a report in \"Vice\" that I think made a pretty good case that there was shadow banning going on against Ronna McDaniel, Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz you just saw, and others. This was part of Twitter's plan to encourage a healthy conversation. The problem is Twitter gets to decide what is healthy. So I don't think it's really a surprise. It's kind of a continuation of what we see, infringement of speech on college campuses. People leave college campuses, they go work for Twitter, and this is continued. So I think it was probably a good idea for the president to point this out and give it prominence.</p><p>EMANUEL: Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\": He was wrong when he said it was illegal. I don't know if we have any actual law that can be cited that's actually illegal, but it's definitely a problem. Twitter and other social media companies that are restricting speech. If you care about the culture of speech, you want to make sure you have this free flow of ideas.</p><p>And I think conservatives have been complaining about this, not just the issue that was mentioned in the report of when you search for a name you can't find it, but actual downplaying of conservatives and hiding what conservatives are tweeting. You are seeing this across different social media platforms. It's partly because they built algorithms that have the bias built into it. They privilege certain types of communication and punish other types of communication. It's a very frustrating experience. You see a lot of people who want to control the discourse in regular media and social media, and it actually leads to a lot of frustration among the average population.</p><p>EMANUEL: Here's more from Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz about this very issue.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA: There are only four members of Congress that I've been notified have been shadow banned, myself, Mark Meadows, Jim Jordan, and Devin Nunes. And the thing that we obviously all have in common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation. So I don't know if that's the reason why we were supposedly inadvertently caught in Twitters troll trap, but it seems very suspicious to me.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS: First I have to say as someone who works on a college campus that invites people from both sides of the aisle, I couldn't let your comment about college campuses go by without at least a subtle pushback.</p><p>YORK: I'll exclude yours.</p><p>ELLEITHEE: I appreciate that.</p><p>When Twitter announced back in May how they were going to go after trolling, my initial thought when I read it is, OK, this is good. Pushing for more civil discourse on social media is a good thing. Trying to push back on those who are trying to disrupt conversation is a good thing. But I remember also thinking, they are going to get stuck here. They're going to catch the wrong people.</p><p>And it seems that this is what is happening here. The fact that Ronna Romney McDaniel had this problem, but someone like an Alex Jones at Info Wars didn't, that seems to be counterintuitive to what they are trying to do. Here's the problem. These social media companies are trying to be good citizens and encourage good debate and good conversation. They are trying to prevent themselves from being manipulated or being used as organizing tools by hate groups or by foreign governments. But at the same time, they want to be platforms for free speech. They are seeing it as a challenge to do all of those things. I applaud the effort for civil discourse, but they have shown that they still have some work to do to figure out how to do it right.</p><p>EMANUEL: OK, next issue, election security. We expect a meeting tomorrow at the White House. Take a listen to this exchange.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: We have got to make sure that we have the right kind of information sharing with states, with secretaries of states, and with anybody else that could see a cyber from Russia.</p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER: House Republicans refuse to act for any oversight, any founding, because they are now more concerned about covering up President Trump's activities than defending our democracy from foreign attack.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: So here we are three plus months away from the next election. How alarmed should we be, Mo?</p><p>ELLEITHEE: I think we should be alarmed. I think every independent analyst that has looked at our elections systems from a nonpartisan perspective keeps pointing to holes in the systems and areas where we are vulnerable. And I would love to see our federal government in a bipartisan way step forward. I don't think any administration has done what it needed to do in recent times. Step forward and figure out how to plug those holes.</p><p>EMANUEL: Mollie?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: The strength of our system is actually how decentralized it is, though. This is very much a local and state issue. If people care about it they should tackle it at the local level. The more you centralize election systems the more vulnerable they are and the more valuable those hacks become.</p><p>ELLEITHEE: You can give more support to the states, though, to do it.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: And we have known about this for a long time. We're having warnings right now, but we've had warnings for four years or more about China trying to do the same thing. So we should be on guard against many foreign entities.</p><p>YORK: This White House meeting, if only for the optics and P.R. of this, they should have had this a long time ago. The midterms are less than 100 days away, and we've had so many accusations that the Trump administration has done nothing to try to stop Russian and other foreign meddling in these upcoming elections when in fact some of these intelligence agencies apparently have been working on this but they won't talk about it. So some sort of public sign that the president and the government are actually doing something is really overdue.</p><p>EMANUEL: Something I would like to get to quickly is the race for House speaker for the next Congress is heating up. Here we are about 100 days out. What do you make of it, Byron?</p><p>YORK: I think you are seeing with the entry of Jim Jordan in the race, I think you're seeing the same dynamics that have driven Republicans in the House crazy, the same dynamic that drove John Boehner crazy, and the same dynamic that has drove Paul Ryan crazy is now showing up again, which is a group of 40 or 50 really conservative Republicans disagreeing with the rest of the party on a lot of key issues.</p><p>EMANUEL: Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I think it's just a healthy thing when you have races that are contested and it helps you understand more about the caucus. Kevin McCarthy is the clear frontrunner. You have a Freedom Caucus candidate who has thrown his hat in the right, and you might see someone from the left also enter the ring. In general, I think these are healthy things. You get to learn more about what issues the Republican caucus cares about, and that will help whoever is the eventual leader know how to manage the caucus.</p><p>EMANUEL: Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>ELLEITHEE: I think a lot of Democrats are excited to see this race between McCarthy and Jordan play out. A lot of it is going to depend on what happens in November and whether this is a race for speaker or a race for minority leader. And if Democrats win back the House I will be curious to see at what expense. When Republicans won back the house it was at the expense of a lot of moderate Democrats. The caucus got then moved to the left. If Democrats win back the House, is it by defeating a lot of freedom caucus type of candidates or more moderate candidates, and that will define this race.</p><p>EMANUEL: All right, we have to leave it there. Next up, the president takes a victory lap after his trade deal.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: I have to say because we have a lot of farmers in this place, we had this hat made up. Look at that, it's John Deere colors actually, but make our farmer great again. Isn't that great?</p><p>These are incredible people, and you know we have given them a little help yesterday. We are giving them help. And everybody is going to be back because we have the greatest farms in the world.</p><p>STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY: This is not a bailout. This is a reciprocal role -- again, we want free and fair reciprocal trade, and that's what we're fighting for.</p><p>To the extent people use political issues to target our farmers, the president will stand up for them.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: Some of the latest talk on trade, and tomorrow we've expecting GDP numbers. And the president gave us a heck of a tease.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: It will only get better. Our numbers are fantastic right now. You're going to see on Friday what happens with GPD. A lot of predictions, a lot of predictions. I told you before, some with a five in front of it. There were predictions frm 3.8 to 5.3.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: It's 3.8 to 5.3, and we are back with our panel, Byron, Mollie, and Mo. Where are we, Byron, on the economy, on these tariffs?</p><p>YORK: I think the biggest economic news of the week could be coming tomorrow. Larry Kudlow came out and all but predicted economic growth for the second quarter at four percent or higher. And if you get four percent economic growth, if you think the president has bragged about the economy before, you just wait until there's actual four percent growth in the economy.</p><p>EMANUEL: Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY: I also think the news we got yesterday about the E.U. moving towards low tariffs or no tariffs with the U.S. is significant news. We've had so much criticism of the Trump administration's tariff policy. People say high tariffs are a really bad thing. The Trump administration, not just President Trump, but you saw this in last night's interview with Wilbur Ross said the strategy is to get to low tariffs. We've had this post-World War II order that saw the ratcheting up of tariffs. Partly that was our desire to help a bunch of more ravaged countries after World War II build up their economy. They don't quite need that now. Some of them are powerhouses themselves. So if you want to renegotiate this, you can't just ask for it. You actually have to threaten it. That's the Trump administration approach here, and their strategy might be paying off.</p><p>EMANUEL: Here is the president talking about what he has worked out with the E.U. Take a listen to this.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We opened up Europe, and that's going to be a great thing for Europe and it's really going to be a great thing for us. And it's going to be a really great thing for our farmers because you have just got yourself one big market that really essentially -- wouldn't you say it never existed, because you just had a problem. So we did that yesterday afternoon. We signed a letter of intent, or agreed to a letter of intent, and we are starting the documents, but the relationship is very, very good.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: All right, Mo, so where are we on trade and tariffs?</p><p>ELLEITHEE: First of all, if I'm correct, the United States was already the greatest exporter of soybeans to Europe, so saying that market wasn't there before is a little off. I will be curious to see what happens here. It feels like we have been here before where it wasn't that long ago that the administration announced a major breakthrough with China when it came to trade negotiations, and it was going to be great for us, and then it fell apart.</p><p>And what we've got is a commitment for a conversation. I'm always for conversation, I'm always for negotiation. We'll see how that plays. But we haven't seen any details yet, we haven't seen any super strong commitment yet. And on a lot of goods, like steel and like aluminum, those tariffs are still in place, and we see -- I know the package talked about one anecdote with one company that was bringing back jobs, but there are lots of anecdotes about companies that are still losing jobs as a result of these tariffs and costs going up. So I think we should encourage the negotiations, but we are not there yet.</p><p>HEMINGWAY: One of the tweets that President Trump had earlier this week that I thought was interesting is when he complained that people were snipping at his heels and that it was difficult to negotiate when you have all this criticism. I took that to mean that he was trying to tell people if you want to get to lower tariffs, you have to play the game here. And to have all this opposition and not figure out what the U.S. is trying to do in taking on some huge structural problems with China but also with other countries where you have regulatory barriers that prevent American companies from selling their products in different places, or intellectual property theft or really high tariffs.</p><p>If you think the status quo is fine, you are opposed to the Trump administration doing anything. If you don't think the status quo is fine, you should be thinking about how to help get to this eventual goal of the Trump administration of lower tariffs. They keep saying it. Trump said it in Canada, he'd like to move to no tariffs, no barriers. If you are a free marketer, if you like that, you should probably figure out what's going on here.</p><p>YORK: The big news yesterday was not that they reach the agreement to get there. It was that they reached an agreement to stop going in the wrong direction, which I think, just stop the threatening and the fighting is probably a good idea. Some of the tariffs are in place already and have not been taken up. But so much of this hysteria about this has been over tariffs that were planned or threatened but are not in effect. So if you can just kind of stopped that and move, as Mollie said, toward a lower tariff world, maybe Trump has had a good idea.</p><p>EMANUEL: I can tell you that a bunch of Republican heads nearly blew up when there was talk about a $12 billion bailout to American farmers, so we'll see where it goes from here.</p><p>When we come back, an incredible success story about socks.</p><p>EMANUEL: Finally tonight, a really feel-good story. A lot of hard work has paid off for a 22-year-old fine young man with Down syndrome. The socket company he founded alongside his dad is now worth $4 million. After just a year and a half, John's Crazy Socks has created 35 jobs and raise around $135,000 for its charity partners. John designs the socks himself and fills the orders.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: John had worn crazy socks his whole life, that was his thing.</p><p>What's our mission?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Our mission is to spread happiness.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL: And John filled some pretty important borders. Former president George Herbert Walker Bush is a fan. John has been exchanging socks with Mr. Bush for the past year or so. And I've got to tell you, I love the story so much, I went on the website and I ordered some socks for myself today. I love a good pair of crazy sock, and you can see some of the former president's fun socks there, Superman, and some other fun stuff.</p><p>That's it for this edition of SPECIAL REPORT. I'm Mike Emanuel in Washington. \"The Story\" with guest host Sandra Smith starts right now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FOXNWS-2018072601cb254</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXNWS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5SWP-YTC1-DXH2-60BH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">174179</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7955\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fox News Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Fox News Network</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"07\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>July 26, 2018 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Government</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Economy</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Trade</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Stock Markets</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Facebook</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Europe</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Media</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Law Enforcement</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Immigration</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Children</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nuclear Weapons</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Middle East</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>War</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Health and Medicine</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>World Affairs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Business &amp;

Hey -- Mike.</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey Juan -- thanks so much.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  You're welcome.</p><p>EMANUEL:  President Trump takes a victory lap on his European trade deal in  the heartland where he talks THE economy, jobs and tariffs.</p><p>Republicans go after Twitter for what they say is discriminatory and  illegal censorship.</p><p>And a new reason for optimism in the search for a treatment for Alzheimer's  disease.</p><p>This is a SPECIAL REPORT.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Good evening.  Welcome to Washington.  I'm Mike Emanuel in for  Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump is right now on his way back to Washington after two  Midwestern stops conveniently-timed for the day after he reached a major  agreement with Europe over trade and tariffs.  While the President is  assuring that better trade times are ahead, not everyone is so sure.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight from the White House.  Good  evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Evening -- Mike.</p><p>The President's tough trade tactics are working, say White House officials,  at least to bring our trading partners to the bargaining table.  But they  also quickly acknowledge that there is a fair amount of anxiety among some  companies and businesses that are afraid they will be caught in the  crossfire.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  -- there are a lot of  farmers in this place.  We had this hat made up.  Look at that.  It's the  John Deere colors actually.  Make our farmers great again.  Isn't that  great.</p><p>CORKE:  Fresh off yesterday's announced framework to improve trade with the  European Union, President Trump today looked to build on that momentum with  a trip to America's heartland.  Mr. Trump using a stop in Dubuque to calm  tariff concerns among Iowa farmers who collectively export a third of the  soybeans that they produce.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Basically we opened up Europe and it's going to be a great thing  for Europe and it's really going to be a great thing for us.  And it's  going to be a really great thing for our farmers because you have just  gotten yourself one big market that really essentially, wouldn't you say,  Kim, never existed because you just had -- you just had a problem.  </p><p>CORKE:  On Twitter Mr. Trump drilled down boasting that \"The E.U. would  start buy soybeans from our great farmers immediately.  His visit to Iowa  and later Illinois comes two days after Mr. Trump announced that his  administration would direct $12 billion to farmers who have been hurt by  tariffs, a plan critics called a bailout, a charge forcefully rejected by  White House officials.  </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout -- this is  reciprocal.  Again -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where will it come from?  </p><p>MNUCHIN:  -- we want free and fair reciprocal trade and that's what we are  fighting for.  </p><p>CORKE:  However, the President's trade agenda has netted mixed results so  far.  Retaliatory tariffs have strained talks with both China and Canada  although there has been steady progress on a new trade deal with Mexico and  now a promising breakthrough with the E.U., the latter of which was met  with a cautious optimism on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISINA:  When you negotiate, there's a chance  that you're not going to win but you can't make progress sometimes without  negotiating and I think that's where we are in the middle of.  </p><p>SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  Well, you know, any time that we  can sit down and start working through the differences, you know, that's --  everyone has a different style but if we can have the end result, we end up  with this fair trade -- I want free and fair trade.  </p><p>CORKE:  But progress is slow and that's particularly the case with  America's largest, single trading partner China, which has intentionally  targeted industries and crops in the Midwest with higher fees in  retaliation for new U.S. tariffs designed to level the trade playing field  -- a subject of great interest at today's Senate Appropriations Committee  hearing.  </p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  If your conclusion is that  China is taking over all of our technology and the future of our children - - it's a stupid (ph) fight, then you are right.  We should capitulate.  My  view is, that's how we got where we are.  I don't think it's a stupid  fight.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Mike -- the U.S. has already slapped about $50 billion in tariffs  on Chinese products with the President threatening to slap another $200  billion on China if they don't back off on tariffs and obviously taking  advantage of our intellectual property -- Mike.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Something to watch there.  </p><p>Now, Kevin -- there's an important meeting taking place at the White House  tomorrow on election security -- what can you tell us about it?  </p><p>CORKE:  Yes, spot on.  The President will chair that meeting of his  national security team.  We are talking about Vice President Mike Pence,  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  And obviously John Bolton, his national  security advisor and others will be here to talk about the importance of  safety and security of our electoral system.</p><p>You heard Kirstjen Nielsen tell Fox News just yesterday, the Homeland  Security Secretary we recognize that Russia meddled in that 2016 campaign,  they possess the capability, Mike, to do it again in 2018 underscoring the  need for the big meeting here tomorrow -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  A huge story tomorrow and in the months ahead.</p><p>Kevin Corke, live at the White House.  Kevin -- many thanks.</p><p>Stocks were mixed as social media giant Facebook took a major hit today.   The Dow gained 113, the S&amp;P 500 was off seven, Nasdaq dropped 80.</p><p>Now, let's examine the short term and long term effects of the European  trade deal and the fall of Facebook on Wall Street today.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton of Fox Business Network joins us live from New York.  Good  evening -- Deirdre.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good evening -- Mike.</p><p>Well, Facebook's $119 billion plus route -- one of the single, biggest  losses in stock market history for any one stock -- is definitely  Facebook's worst day ever by far.  So the stock plunged at 19 percent; it  closed near that level.  So the company missed quarterly revenue forecast,  it lowered its outlook and it said its revenue growth rate will slow.</p><p>Some investors are worried that while Facebook's user growth is stalling,  it's spending more.  The company committed to investing billions of dollars  per year on developing stronger privacy measures.  The company has faced  bruising headlines about its role in enabling fake news and election  meddling so some see these decisions as necessary.</p><p>Optimists say Facebook has more than two billion global users, it will  figure out its next best steps.  One contextual point, the company's  previous worst single day performance, you have to go back to July 2012.   The stock fell more than 11.5 percent at that time.  The company and  pivoted to selling mobile advertising and investors doubted that strategy.   Now it makes up 91 percent of the company's ad revenue.</p><p>But no matter what the future holds, today's drop sent founder and CEO Mark  Zuckerberg's personal net worth plummeting by more than $11 billion --  Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Ok.  So that's something we'll be watching Deirdre.</p><p>But from the negative to the positive -- what are the short term and long  term effects of this European trade deal?</p><p>BOLTON:  So President Trump -- his meeting with the E.C. president Jean- Claude Juncker put a pause in an escalating trade war, so that's a bright  spot.  Europe says it's going to buy more American soybeans and more  American liquid natural gas.</p><p>Soybeans are the U.S.'s biggest agri export and buying with more from  Europe is going to counter what China is not buying.  If Europe buys more  American liquid natural gas, it could be a win-win for both regions.   Analysts say the U.S. could become the world's biggest supplier of liquid  natural gas in the next five years which would equal U.S. job creation.</p><p>For Europe the win is decreasing its dependence on Russia.  Russia has a 35  percent market share as a gas supplier in Europe and Russia is  unpredictable.  It cut off pipelines in Eastern Europe in 2006, again in  2007 and '08 and again in 2014 with harsh winter conditions.  There were  casualties.  Some experts say Russia uses its natural gas supply as a  weapon.</p><p>The business question though for American liquid natural gas suppliers is  that they can sell at higher prices in Asia because Chinese manufacturing  is on fire.  So those company heads will have some big decisions ahead. </p><p>Mike -- back to you.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Deirdre Bolton from Fox Business -- thanks very much.</p><p>BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Republicans are going after Twitter tonight.  They say the social  media giant has purposely kept some of them from appearing in search  results.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy reports on what some consider the latest example  of ideological censorship from the left.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Congressman Matt Gaetz is one of the  Republicans whose Twitter handle was hidden for months from some curious  users searching for him.  Type his name and he didn't pop up.</p><p>Today the President whose Twitter account helped get him elected wrote,  \"Twitter shadow-banning prominent Republicans -- not good.  We will look  into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many complaints.\"</p><p>Another one of the allegedly blocked Republicans RNC chair Ronna McDaniel.  </p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESWOMAN:  It took a tweet from the President of  the United States to get Twitter to care about every day Republican voters.   That's very troubling.</p><p>DOOCY:  The conservative shadow-ban appears to have been fixed this morning  for the first time since May when Twitter announced it would crackdown on  trolls contributing to an unhealthy dialogue and Twitter staffers explained  \"Some troll-like behavior is fun, good and humorous.  What we are talking  about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the  public conversation on Twitter particularly in communal areas like  conversations and search.\"</p><p>Those search bar changes aren't known to have impacted any Democrats.  The  spokesman for Donald Trump Jr. Andrew Sarabian claimed he was shadow- banned, too.  He tells Fox News, \"The targeted censorship of conservatives  on Twitter isn't some fringe conspiracy theory, it's actually happening.\"</p><p>Twitter insists \"Our behavioral ranking doesn't make judgments based on  political views or the substance of tweets.\"  Congressman Gaetz isn't so  sure.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I have been notified to have been shadow-banned -- myself, Mark Meadows,  Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.</p><p>DOOCY:  In 2017, a Twitter employee deactivated President Trump's account  because he didn't like his policies but it was live again 11 minutes later.  </p><p>These new accusations of bias may be probed for months.</p><p>GAETZ:  This is no different than if a billboard company were to make a  donation to my opponents and not the same donation to me, that would be an  illegal corporate contribution and we're reviewing our options to complain  to the Federal Elections Commission about the way Twitter has treated us.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY:  So much talk about social media here in Washington has been about  how the Russians used it to meddle in the last election.  But the alleged  interference being discussed today didn't originate at the Kremlin, it came  from California -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Peter Doocy reporting on Capitol Hill.  Peter -- thanks.</p><p>Conservative Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan wants to be the next speaker of  the house next year.  Jordan made the announcement last night and sent his  letter to colleagues today.  Jordan is a former chairman of the House  Freedom Caucus.  He faces likely competition from Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy and with Steve Scalise.  Current Speaker Paul Ryan is retiring at  the end of his term.</p><p>House Republicans are divided tonight over impeachment proceedings against  the number two official in the Justice Department.</p><p>Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge looks at both sides  tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Do I support impeachment of  Rod Rosenstein?  No, I do not.  </p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The House  Speaker characterized the articles of impeachment filed by the House  Freedom Caucus as an extreme step.  </p><p>RYAN:  I don't think we should be cavalier with this process or with this  term.  I don't think that this rises to the level of high crimes and  misdemeanors.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  Among the allegations: the deputy attorney general Rod  Rosenstein has a conflict of interest overseeing the Russia probe because  he signed the final surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter  Page based in part on the unverified Trump dossier.</p><p>Months earlier, the former British spy behind the dossier, Christopher  Steele, was fired by the FBI for lying.  Steele also admitted his hatred  for candidate Trump.  </p><p>According to the articles of impeachment, quote, \"Deputy attorney general  Rosenstein's failure to recuse himself in light of this inherent conflict  of interest constitutes dereliction of duty.\"  </p><p>GAETZ:  It was very frustrating to hear the speaker call our efforts  cavalier.  Christopher Steele lied to the FBI.  Rod Rosenstein knew that  and was so cavalier that he thought that his information was still a basis  to spy on people associated with the Trump campaign.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  Democrats claim the goal is discrediting special counsel Robert  Mueller's Russia probe.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Just when you think  you've seen it all, Republicans have no shame to go to a place where they  would undermine our judicial system.  </p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  If it's in the service of this  president, that's all they care about.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  A charge one key Republicans denies.  </p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), North Carolina:  I haven't discussed it with the  President and so I can tell you at this point who the President hires and  fires IS certainly not going to be influenced by something that this member  of congress does.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  In Boston the attorney general said house Republicans should  refocus and defended the department's number two.  </p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  My deputy, Rod Rosenstein, is highly  capable.  I have the highest confidence in him.  We need Congress to deal  with immigration questions.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  The Justice Department failed to provide the withheld records.   A Republican aide said tonight they have a commitment from leadership to  hold a vote on a contempt resolution after the recess in early September,  insisting impeachment remains on the table -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Catherine Herridge -- thanks very much.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>EMANUEL:  The Associated Press is reporting documents from a London-based  investigative unit indicate the Moscow lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr.  and is said to have promised the presidential campaign -- the Trump  presidential campaign -- dirt on Hillary Clinton, worked more closely with  Russian government officials than she previously let on.</p><p>The AP says the documents are from a company run by a Russian opposition  figure.  The documents reportedly paint a picture of Natalia Veselnitskaya  as a well-connected attorney who served as a ghost writer for top Russian  government lawyers and received assistance from senior interior ministry  personnel.  She has previously denied acting as representative of Russian  authorities.</p><p>Today is the deadline for the Trump administration to reunite children and  parents separated at the southern border during its zero-tolerance  enforcement.</p><p>Correspondent Casey Stegall tells us where things stand tonight from  Dallas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  More than a thousand reunions have  taken place and hundreds more have been approved ahead of today's deadline  to have all children back with their families after being separated at the  border.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I was sad.  It was hard because I  wasn't together with my papa.  </p><p>STEGALL:  The federal judge who set the deadline saying it appears the U.S.  government was on track to meet it, even calling its efforts to reunite  more than 2,500 total kids a quote, \"remarkable achievement\" though ACLU  lawyers claim federal authorities manipulated numbers in the government's  favor.  </p><p>LEE GELERNT:  There are many other people that will ultimately need to be  reunified.  So when they say they are going to meet the deadlines it's only  for those individuals they declared to be eligible for reunification by the  deadline.  </p><p>STEGALL:  He is referring to the more than 900 children that the government  puts into the ineligible category.  According to court documents, more than  450 involve a parent who has already been deported.  </p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  So these are parents  who have made the decision not to bring the children with them and then  will continue to work with the court to understand how we can best comply  with the order.  </p><p>STEGALL:  The ACLU and other immigration lawyers claim some of the people  left without their kids because they may have been misled by federal  officials.  </p><p>ROBERT LOPEZ, TEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT:  It's going to be difficult for  parents who are in a different country and, you know, may not know how to  navigate the OR, the Office of Refugee Resettlement System.  </p><p>STEGALL:  U.S. district judge Dana Sombra did admonish the Department of  Justice for separating families without a plan in place, saying it quote,  \"lacked forethought with regard to keeping track of people\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEGALL:  Both sides will be back in court tomorrow updating the judge on  final numbers and to provide a status update on its continued efforts,  despite the deadline then being officially up -- Mike.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Casey Stegall, live in Dallas on this important immigration  issue.  Casey -- thanks a lot.</p><p>Up next, a major step in improving relations between the U.S. and North  Korea.</p><p>First, here's what some of our Fox affiliates around the country are  covering tonight.</p><p>Fox 35 in Orlando as the Walt Disney Company says it will stop providing  single-use plastic straws and plastic stirrers at all of its locations.   Disney officials say the policy will be in place by mid-2019 and as part of  the company's long-standing commitment to environmental stewardship.</p><p>Fox 2 in St. Louis as Missouri's second most populous county is the latest  municipality to sue opioid makers, distributors and pharmacies over what it  calls the worst man-made epidemic in modern medical history. </p><p>Jackson County says the epidemic has burdened the county with opioid- related hospitalizations, emergency medical responses to overdoses, babies  born in withdrawal, incarcerations and child welfare cases.</p><p>And this is a live look at Los Angeles from Fox 11.  The big story there  tonight, a fast-moving wildfire believed to have been sparked by arson is  tearing through trees, has burned five homes and forced evacuation orders  for an entire mountain community.  About 3,200 people in Idyllwild and  nearby communities were ordered to leave their homes.  An estimated 600  structures are threatened.  This comes as California swelters under a heat  wave and battles ferocious fires at both ends of the state.</p><p>That's tonight's live look outside the Beltway from SPECIAL REPORT.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>EMANUEL:  President Trump is threatening sanctions against Turkey if it  does not free an American pastor detained for two years on terror and  espionage charges.  Just yesterday Turkey released Pastor Andrew Brunson  from jail but left him under house arrest.  The President made his threat  today over Twitter.  Vice President Mike Pence delivered the same message  during a speech last night.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  To President Erdogan and  the Turkish government, I have a message on behalf of the President of the  United States of America.  Released Pastor Andrew Brunson now or be  prepared to face the consequences.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Turkey has previously linked Brunson's return to the extradition  of a cleric it holds responsible for the failed July 2016 military coup.</p><p>The State Department is warning American companies they could face steep  fines or even criminal charges if their business involves North Korean  workers anywhere in their supply chain.</p><p>Tonight -- another potential thaw in relations with the Hermit Kingdom.</p><p>Here is senior foreign affairs correspondent Greg Palkot.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>GREG PALKOT, FOX NEWS SENIOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS CORRESPONDENT:  Expected to be  returned as early as Friday, the 65th anniversary of the armistice that  ended the Korean War, the remains of 55 U.S. service members missing in  North Korea since that war.</p><p>A U.S. official tells Fox News it is anticipated the remains will be flown  from North Korea in wooden caskets on a U.S. military aircraft to a base in  the South.  </p><p>JASON CHAFFETZ, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR:  We are at a better place than we  were six months ago.  I think the relationship, the dialogue, there is some  movement getting our hostages back, getting the servicemen back.  </p><p>PALKOT:  They will be catalogued and transferred to a center in Hawaii for  final DNA identification before being returned to families.  The return of  the remains was a major commitment made by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un  to President Trump last month in Singapore.  Some 5,300 U.S. service  members are still missing there.  </p><p>TRUMP:  The remains will be coming back.  They're going to start that  process immediately.  </p><p>PALKOT:  Earlier this week analysts said satellite photos indicated North  Korea was dismantling facilities at a missile test site.  With South Korean  President Moon, a new U.S. ambassador to South Korea, former Admiral Harry  Harris said the moves would be positive.</p><p>Still there's a lot of pressure on the Trump administration to deliver.   Secretary of State Pompeo's latest trip to Pyongyang came up short on  specifics from the North on getting rid of its nukes.  </p><p>OLIVIA ENOS, HERITAGE FOUNDATION:  We should view this as a positive step  but not necessarily overstate its benefits.  And you know, we still have to  watch and see what North Korea does when it comes to denuclearization.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PALKOT:  That U.S. official warned us when dealing with North Korea it's  not over until it's over.  After delays, at least for the sake of the  families of the service members involved, the hope is this time it's for  real -- Mike.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Greg Palkot -- thanks very much.</p><p>More fighting tonight between Israel and the Palestinians -- the Israeli  military says it intercepted a rocket fired from Gaza.  Yesterday Israeli  shelling of Hamas targets left three militants dead.  Today they were  remembered.</p><p>Correspondent Conor Powell shows us from Jerusalem.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CONOR POWELL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Thousands of Palestinians in Gaza  gather today to mourn the death of three Hamas fighters killed by Israeli  tank fire.  Their deaths follow the shooting of an Israeli soldier  Wednesday.  Fighting has intensified along the Gaza security fence in  recent days despite both sides agreeing to a cease-fire in the wake of  months of weekly protests organized by Hamas in response to President  Trump's decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.</p><p>Palestinians are also demanding an end to the Israeli blockade around Gaza  -- with Hamas vowing to defend Palestinian people.</p><p>The weekly clashes have left more than 150 Palestinians dead and thousands  more injured.  In recent weeks, militants have launched flaming kites and  balloon to burn Israeli fields and properties.</p><p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is vowing to continue targeting  Hamas until the rockets and burning kites stop.  </p><p>BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER (through translator):  We will  do whatever it takes to protect the security not only of the community  surrounding Gaza but of the state of Israel.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>POWELL:  In the past the violence we're seeing around Gaza has often led to  a full-on war but despite the regular clashes it appears both Israel and  Hamas along with Egypt are trying to prevent the situation from escalating  further.  But that might be easier to say than to actually do -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Conor Powell from Jerusalem -- thanks very much.</p><p>Up next, the winners and losers from the President's trade and tariff  policy.</p><p>First, beyond our borders tonight.</p><p>At least 216 people have died from coordinated attacks by ISIS on a  typically peaceful area of southern Syria.  Mass funerals were held today.   The area was the scene of several suicide bombings including one at a busy  vegetable market that left devastation and set in motion the coordinated  assaults.</p><p>Authorities in Poland have banned swimming at more than 50 Baltic Sea  beaches after hot weather led to the toxic growth of bacteria in the  unusually warm water.

Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us about a  new drug that might help slow the mental decline of Alzheimer's patients.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. KEITH FARGO, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION:  Potentially this is a  breakthrough drug.  </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The long and discouraging medical  quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is looking promising  thanks to newly released results from a large-scale clinical trial.  Phase  two test results for a new drug known as a BAN2401 were rolled out at the  Alzheimer's Association international conference in Chicago yesterday, and  it's setting in the medical community abuzz with hope.  </p><p>FARGO:  There is a great feeling of progress happening in the field, and  everyone was very excited to hear the release of these results.  </p><p>TURNER:  Preliminary results show BAN2401 may have the ability to  successfully attack both changes to the brain brought about by the growth  of plaque and the symptoms it causes.  There is currently no effective  treatment for Alzheimer's aside from a couple of medications that slow down  memory decline for a period of months.  </p><p>But according to the Alzheimer's Association, the global urgency to better  treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is higher than  ever and growing.  This disease is devastating for Americans, 5.7 million  currently live with it, and by 2,050 this number will rise to 14 million.   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a national plan  to address Alzheimer's disease that seeks to find a treatment by 2,025.   BAN2401 may be the most hopeful piece of that puzzle.  </p><p>FARGO:  If this pans out in larger studies, this is what we would call a  disease modifying drug, which is something the field does not yet have.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER:  Experts also caution there's still a very long road ahead and  probably years before BAN2401 gets approved for patients used.  The  Japanese company that developed the drug just recently submitted an FDA  request to initiate that approval process.  Until then someone in America  is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every 65 seconds.  Mike?</p><p>EMANUEL:  Gillian Turner reporting.  Gillian, thanks very much.</p><p>As Republicans accuse Twitter of shadow banning, we'll look at social media  politics.  The panel joins me when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  When people search on Twitter for an account  that they might want to follow, typically those search results auto  complete or auto fill in.  But if people were searching for me or other  prominent conservatives in the Congress, our accounts weren't coming up.   That was not the same treatment given to Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and  others on the left.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA:  It sound like a coincidence, kind of  like when you disagree with President Putin you have a heart attack?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Senator Kennedy always has a good line.  Then there was quite the  moment on the Internet when you had President Trump go after Twitter come  on Twitter.  \"Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.  We  will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many  complaints.\"  </p><p>Can Twitter live to fight another day?  Let's bring in our panel, Byron  York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Mollie  Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Mo Elleithee, executive  director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics.  OK, Byron, what do you  make of was there some shadow banning going on on Twitter?  </p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  It  appears there was.  I don't think there's any doubt that these big tech  companies do lean left.  There was a report in \"Vice\" that I think made a  pretty good case that there was shadow banning going on against Ronna  McDaniel, Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz you just saw, and others.  This was part  of Twitter's plan to encourage a healthy conversation.  The problem is  Twitter gets to decide what is healthy.  So I don't think it's really a  surprise.  It's kind of a continuation of what we see, infringement of  speech on college campuses.  People leave college campuses, they go work  for Twitter, and this is continued.  So I think it was probably a good idea  for the president to point this out and give it prominence.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  He was wrong when he  said it was illegal.  I don't know if we have any actual law that can be  cited that's actually illegal, but it's definitely a problem.  Twitter and  other social media companies that are restricting speech.  If you care  about the culture of speech, you want to make sure you have this free flow  of ideas. </p><p>And I think conservatives have been complaining about this, not just the  issue that was mentioned in the report of when you search for a name you  can't find it, but actual downplaying of conservatives and hiding what  conservatives are tweeting.  You are seeing this across different social  media platforms.  It's partly because they built algorithms that have the  bias built into it.  They privilege certain types of communication and  punish other types of communication.  It's a very frustrating experience.   You see a lot of people who want to control the discourse in regular media  and social media, and it actually leads to a lot of frustration among the  average population.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Here's more from Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz about this very  issue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I've been notified have been shadow banned, myself, Mark Meadows, Jim  Jordan, and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.  So I don't  know if that's the reason why we were supposedly inadvertently caught in  Twitters troll trap, but it seems very suspicious to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS:  First  I have to say as someone who works on a college campus that invites people  from both sides of the aisle, I couldn't let your comment about college  campuses go by without at least a subtle pushback.  </p><p>YORK:  I'll exclude yours.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I appreciate that.  </p><p>When Twitter announced back in May how they were going to go after  trolling, my initial thought when I read it is, OK, this is good.  Pushing  for more civil discourse on social media is a good thing.  Trying to push  back on those who are trying to disrupt conversation is a good thing.  But  I remember also thinking, they are going to get stuck here.  They're going  to catch the wrong people.  </p><p>And it seems that this is what is happening here.  The fact that Ronna  Romney McDaniel had this problem, but someone like an Alex Jones at Info  Wars didn't, that seems to be counterintuitive to what they are trying to  do.  Here's the problem.  These social media companies are trying to be  good citizens and encourage good debate and good conversation.  They are  trying to prevent themselves from being manipulated or being used as  organizing tools by hate groups or by foreign governments.  But at the same  time, they want to be platforms for free speech.  They are seeing it as a  challenge to do all of those things.  I applaud the effort for civil  discourse, but they have shown that they still have some work to do to  figure out how to do it right.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  OK, next issue, election security.  We expect a meeting tomorrow  at the White House.  Take a listen to this exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  We have got  to make sure that we have the right kind of information sharing with  states, with secretaries of states, and with anybody else that could see a  cyber from Russia.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  House Republicans refuse to  act for any oversight, any founding, because they are now more concerned  about covering up President Trump's activities than defending our democracy  from foreign attack.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  So here we are three plus months away from the next election.   How alarmed should we be, Mo?  </p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I think we should be alarmed.  I think every independent  analyst that has looked at our elections systems from a nonpartisan  perspective keeps pointing to holes in the systems and areas where we are  vulnerable.  And I would love to see our federal government in a bipartisan  way step forward.  I don't think any administration has done what it needed  to do in recent times.  Step forward and figure out how to plug those  holes.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  The strength of our system is actually how decentralized it is,  though.  This is very much a local and state issue.  If people care about  it they should tackle it at the local level.  The more you centralize  election systems the more vulnerable they are and the more valuable those  hacks become.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  You can give more support to the states, though, to do it.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  And we have known about this for a long time.  We're having  warnings right now, but we've had warnings for four years or more about  China trying to do the same thing.  So we should be on guard against many  foreign entities.  </p><p>YORK:  This White House meeting, if only for the optics and P.R. of this,  they should have had this a long time ago.  The midterms are less than 100  days away, and we've had so many accusations that the Trump administration  has done nothing to try to stop Russian and other foreign meddling in these  upcoming elections when in fact some of these intelligence agencies  apparently have been working on this but they won't talk about it.  So some  sort of public sign that the president and the government are actually  doing something is really overdue.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Something I would like to get to quickly is the race for House  speaker for the next Congress is heating up.  Here we are about 100 days  out.  What do you make of it, Byron?  </p><p>YORK:  I think you are seeing with the entry of Jim Jordan in the race, I  think you're seeing the same dynamics that have driven Republicans in the  House crazy, the same dynamic that drove John Boehner crazy, and the same  dynamic that has drove Paul Ryan crazy is now showing up again, which is a  group of 40 or 50 really conservative Republicans disagreeing with the rest  of the party on a lot of key issues.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I think it's just a healthy thing when you have races that are  contested and it helps you understand more about the caucus.  Kevin  McCarthy is the clear frontrunner.  You have a Freedom Caucus candidate who  has thrown his hat in the right, and you might see someone from the left  also enter the ring.  In general, I think these are healthy things.  You  get to learn more about what issues the Republican caucus cares about, and  that will help whoever is the eventual leader know how to manage the  caucus.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I think a lot of Democrats are excited to see this race between  McCarthy and Jordan play out.  A lot of it is going to depend on what  happens in November and whether this is a race for speaker or a race for  minority leader.  And if Democrats win back the House I will be curious to  see at what expense.  When Republicans won back the house it was at the  expense of a lot of moderate Democrats.  The caucus got then moved to the  left.  If Democrats win back the House, is it by defeating a lot of freedom  caucus type of candidates or more moderate candidates, and that will define  this race.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  All right, we have to leave it there.  Next up, the president  takes a victory lap after his trade deal.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have to say because we  have a lot of farmers in this place, we had this hat made up.  Look at  that, it's John Deere colors actually, but make our farmer great again.   Isn't that great?</p><p>These are incredible people, and you know we have given them a little help  yesterday.  We are giving them help.  And everybody is going to be back  because we have the greatest farms in the world.  </p><p>STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout.  This is a  reciprocal role -- again, we want free and fair reciprocal trade, and  that's what we're fighting for.  </p><p>To the extent people use political issues to target our farmers, the  president will stand up for them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Some of the latest talk on trade, and tomorrow we've expecting  GDP numbers.  And the president gave us a heck of a tease.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will only get better.   Our numbers are fantastic right now.  You're going to see on Friday what  happens with GPD.  A lot of predictions, a lot of predictions.  I told you  before, some with a five in front of it.  There were predictions frm 3.8 to  5.3.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  It's 3.8 to 5.3, and we are back with our panel, Byron, Mollie,  and Mo.  Where are we, Byron, on the economy, on these tariffs?  </p><p>YORK:  I think the biggest economic news of the week could be coming  tomorrow.  Larry Kudlow came out and all but predicted economic growth for  the second quarter at four percent or higher.  And if you get four percent  economic growth, if you think the president has bragged about the economy  before, you just wait until there's actual four percent growth in the  economy.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I also think the news we got yesterday about the E.U. moving  towards low tariffs or no tariffs with the U.S. is significant news.  We've  had so much criticism of the Trump administration's tariff policy.  People  say high tariffs are a really bad thing.  The Trump administration, not  just President Trump, but you saw this in last night's interview with  Wilbur Ross said the strategy is to get to low tariffs.  We've had this  post-World War II order that saw the ratcheting up of tariffs.  Partly that  was our desire to help a bunch of more ravaged countries after World War II  build up their economy.  They don't quite need that now.  Some of them are  powerhouses themselves.  So if you want to renegotiate this, you can't just  ask for it.  You actually have to threaten it.  That's the Trump  administration approach here, and their strategy might be paying off.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Here is the president talking about what he has worked out with  the E.U.  Take a listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We opened up Europe, and  that's going to be a great thing for Europe and it's really going to be a  great thing for us.  And it's going to be a really great thing for our  farmers because you have just got yourself one big market that really  essentially -- wouldn't you say it never existed, because you just had a  problem.  So we did that yesterday afternoon.  We signed a letter of  intent, or agreed to a letter of intent, and we are starting the documents,  but the relationship is very, very good.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  All right, Mo, so where are we on trade and tariffs?  </p><p>ELLEITHEE:  First of all, if I'm correct, the United States was already the  greatest exporter of soybeans to Europe, so saying that market wasn't there  before is a little off.  I will be curious to see what happens here.  It  feels like we have been here before where it wasn't that long ago that the  administration announced a major breakthrough with China when it came to  trade negotiations, and it was going to be great for us, and then it fell  apart.  </p><p>And what we've got is a commitment for a conversation.  I'm always for  conversation, I'm always for negotiation.  We'll see how that plays.  But  we haven't seen any details yet, we haven't seen any super strong  commitment yet.  And on a lot of goods, like steel and like aluminum, those  tariffs are still in place, and we see -- I know the package talked about  one anecdote with one company that was bringing back jobs, but there are  lots of anecdotes about companies that are still losing jobs as a result of  these tariffs and costs going up.  So I think we should encourage the  negotiations, but we are not there yet.  </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  One of the tweets that President Trump had earlier this week  that I thought was interesting is when he complained that people were  snipping at his heels and that it was difficult to negotiate when you have  all this criticism.  I took that to mean that he was trying to tell people  if you want to get to lower tariffs, you have to play the game here.  And  to have all this opposition and not figure out what the U.S. is trying to  do in taking on some huge structural problems with China but also with  other countries where you have regulatory barriers that prevent American  companies from selling their products in different places, or intellectual  property theft or really high tariffs.  </p><p>If you think the status quo is fine, you are opposed to the Trump  administration doing anything.  If you don't think the status quo is fine,  you should be thinking about how to help get to this eventual goal of the  Trump administration of lower tariffs.  They keep saying it.  Trump said it  in Canada, he'd like to move to no tariffs, no barriers.  If you are a free  marketer, if you like that, you should probably figure out what's going on  here.  </p><p>YORK:  The big news yesterday was not that they reach the agreement to get  there.  It was that they reached an agreement to stop going in the wrong  direction, which I think, just stop the threatening and the fighting is  probably a good idea.  Some of the tariffs are in place already and have  not been taken up.  But so much of this hysteria about this has been over  tariffs that were planned or threatened but are not in effect.  So if you  can just kind of stopped that and move, as Mollie said, toward a lower  tariff world, maybe Trump has had a good idea.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  I can tell you that a bunch of Republican heads nearly blew up  when there was talk about a $12 billion bailout to American farmers, so  we'll see where it goes from here.  </p><p>When we come back, an incredible success story about socks.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Finally tonight, a really feel-good story.  A lot of hard work  has paid off for a 22-year-old fine young man with Down syndrome.  The  socket company he founded alongside his dad is now worth $4 million.  After  just a year and a half, John's Crazy Socks has created 35 jobs and raise  around $135,000 for its charity partners.  John designs the socks himself  and fills the orders.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  John had worn crazy socks his whole life, that was his  thing.  </p><p>What's our mission?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our mission is to spread happiness.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  And John filled some pretty important borders.  Former president  George Herbert Walker Bush is a fan.  John has been exchanging socks with  Mr. Bush for the past year or so.  And I've got to tell you, I love the  story so much, I went on the website and I ordered some socks for myself  today.  I love a good pair of crazy sock, and you can see some of the  former president's fun socks there, Superman, and some other fun stuff.  </p><p>That's it for this edition of SPECIAL REPORT.  I'm Mike Emanuel in  Washington.  \"The Story\" with guest host Sandra Smith starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Never miss an episode of  \"THE FIVE.</p><p>SPECIAL REPORT is up next.  Guess what -- Mike Emanuel is in for Bret  Baier.  Hey -- Mike.</p><p>MIKE EMANUEL, FOX NEWS ANCHOR:  Hey Juan -- thanks so much.</p><p>WILLIAMS:  You're welcome.</p><p>EMANUEL:  President Trump takes a victory lap on his European trade deal in  the heartland where he talks THE economy, jobs and tariffs.</p><p>Republicans go after Twitter for what they say is discriminatory and  illegal censorship.</p><p>And a new reason for optimism in the search for a treatment for Alzheimer's  disease.</p><p>This is a SPECIAL REPORT.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Good evening.  Welcome to Washington.  I'm Mike Emanuel in for  Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump is right now on his way back to Washington after two  Midwestern stops conveniently-timed for the day after he reached a major  agreement with Europe over trade and tariffs.  While the President is  assuring that better trade times are ahead, not everyone is so sure.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight from the White House.  Good  evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Evening -- Mike.</p><p>The President's tough trade tactics are working, say White House officials,  at least to bring our trading partners to the bargaining table.  But they  also quickly acknowledge that there is a fair amount of anxiety among some  companies and businesses that are afraid they will be caught in the  crossfire.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  -- there are a lot of  farmers in this place.  We had this hat made up.  Look at that.  It's the  John Deere colors actually.  Make our farmers great again.  Isn't that  great.</p><p>CORKE:  Fresh off yesterday's announced framework to improve trade with the  European Union, President Trump today looked to build on that momentum with  a trip to America's heartland.  Mr. Trump using a stop in Dubuque to calm  tariff concerns among Iowa farmers who collectively export a third of the  soybeans that they produce.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Basically we opened up Europe and it's going to be a great thing  for Europe and it's really going to be a great thing for us.  And it's  going to be a really great thing for our farmers because you have just  gotten yourself one big market that really essentially, wouldn't you say,  Kim, never existed because you just had -- you just had a problem.  </p><p>CORKE:  On Twitter Mr. Trump drilled down boasting that \"The E.U. would  start buy soybeans from our great farmers immediately.  His visit to Iowa  and later Illinois comes two days after Mr. Trump announced that his  administration would direct $12 billion to farmers who have been hurt by  tariffs, a plan critics called a bailout, a charge forcefully rejected by  White House officials.  </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout -- this is  reciprocal.  Again -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where will it come from?  </p><p>MNUCHIN:  -- we want free and fair reciprocal trade and that's what we are  fighting for.  </p><p>CORKE:  However, the President's trade agenda has netted mixed results so  far.  Retaliatory tariffs have strained talks with both China and Canada  although there has been steady progress on a new trade deal with Mexico and  now a promising breakthrough with the E.U., the latter of which was met  with a cautious optimism on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISINA:  When you negotiate, there's a chance  that you're not going to win but you can't make progress sometimes without  negotiating and I think that's where we are in the middle of.  </p><p>SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  Well, you know, any time that we  can sit down and start working through the differences, you know, that's --  everyone has a different style but if we can have the end result, we end up  with this fair trade -- I want free and fair trade.  </p><p>CORKE:  But progress is slow and that's particularly the case with  America's largest, single trading partner China, which has intentionally  targeted industries and crops in the Midwest with higher fees in  retaliation for new U.S. tariffs designed to level the trade playing field  -- a subject of great interest at today's Senate Appropriations Committee  hearing.  </p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  If your conclusion is that  China is taking over all of our technology and the future of our children - - it's a stupid (ph) fight, then you are right.  We should capitulate.  My  view is, that's how we got where we are.  I don't think it's a stupid  fight.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Mike -- the U.S. has already slapped about $50 billion in tariffs  on Chinese products with the President threatening to slap another $200  billion on China if they don't back off on tariffs and obviously taking  advantage of our intellectual property -- Mike.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Something to watch there.  </p><p>Now, Kevin -- there's an important meeting taking place at the White House  tomorrow on election security -- what can you tell us about it?  </p><p>CORKE:  Yes, spot on.  The President will chair that meeting of his  national security team.  We are talking about Vice President Mike Pence,  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  And obviously John Bolton, his national  security advisor and others will be here to talk about the importance of  safety and security of our electoral system.</p><p>You heard Kirstjen Nielsen tell Fox News just yesterday, the Homeland  Security Secretary we recognize that Russia meddled in that 2016 campaign,  they possess the capability, Mike, to do it again in 2018 underscoring the  need for the big meeting here tomorrow -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  A huge story tomorrow and in the months ahead.</p><p>Kevin Corke, live at the White House.  Kevin -- many thanks.</p><p>Stocks were mixed as social media giant Facebook took a major hit today.   The Dow gained 113, the S&amp;P 500 was off seven, Nasdaq dropped 80.</p><p>Now, let's examine the short term and long term effects of the European  trade deal and the fall of Facebook on Wall Street today.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton of Fox Business Network joins us live from New York.  Good  evening -- Deirdre.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good evening -- Mike.</p><p>Well, Facebook's $119 billion plus route -- one of the single, biggest  losses in stock market history for any one stock -- is definitely  Facebook's worst day ever by far.  So the stock plunged at 19 percent; it  closed near that level.  So the company missed quarterly revenue forecast,  it lowered its outlook and it said its revenue growth rate will slow.</p><p>Some investors are worried that while Facebook's user growth is stalling,  it's spending more.  The company committed to investing billions of dollars  per year on developing stronger privacy measures.  The company has faced  bruising headlines about its role in enabling fake news and election  meddling so some see these decisions as necessary.</p><p>Optimists say Facebook has more than two billion global users, it will  figure out its next best steps.  One contextual point, the company's  previous worst single day performance, you have to go back to July 2012.   The stock fell more than 11.5 percent at that time.  The company and  pivoted to selling mobile advertising and investors doubted that strategy.   Now it makes up 91 percent of the company's ad revenue.</p><p>But no matter what the future holds, today's drop sent founder and CEO Mark  Zuckerberg's personal net worth plummeting by more than $11 billion --  Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Ok.  So that's something we'll be watching Deirdre.</p><p>But from the negative to the positive -- what are the short term and long  term effects of this European trade deal?</p><p>BOLTON:  So President Trump -- his meeting with the E.C. president Jean- Claude Juncker put a pause in an escalating trade war, so that's a bright  spot.  Europe says it's going to buy more American soybeans and more  American liquid natural gas.</p><p>Soybeans are the U.S.'s biggest agri export and buying with more from  Europe is going to counter what China is not buying.  If Europe buys more  American liquid natural gas, it could be a win-win for both regions.   Analysts say the U.S. could become the world's biggest supplier of liquid  natural gas in the next five years which would equal U.S. job creation.</p><p>For Europe the win is decreasing its dependence on Russia.  Russia has a 35  percent market share as a gas supplier in Europe and Russia is  unpredictable.  It cut off pipelines in Eastern Europe in 2006, again in  2007 and '08 and again in 2014 with harsh winter conditions.  There were  casualties.  Some experts say Russia uses its natural gas supply as a  weapon.</p><p>The business question though for American liquid natural gas suppliers is  that they can sell at higher prices in Asia because Chinese manufacturing  is on fire.  So those company heads will have some big decisions ahead. </p><p>Mike -- back to you.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Deirdre Bolton from Fox Business -- thanks very much.</p><p>BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Republicans are going after Twitter tonight.  They say the social  media giant has purposely kept some of them from appearing in search  results.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy reports on what some consider the latest example  of ideological censorship from the left.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Congressman Matt Gaetz is one of the  Republicans whose Twitter handle was hidden for months from some curious  users searching for him.  Type his name and he didn't pop up.</p><p>Today the President whose Twitter account helped get him elected wrote,  \"Twitter shadow-banning prominent Republicans -- not good.  We will look  into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many complaints.\"</p><p>Another one of the allegedly blocked Republicans RNC chair Ronna McDaniel.  </p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESWOMAN:  It took a tweet from the President of  the United States to get Twitter to care about every day Republican voters.   That's very troubling.</p><p>DOOCY:  The conservative shadow-ban appears to have been fixed this morning  for the first time since May when Twitter announced it would crackdown on  trolls contributing to an unhealthy dialogue and Twitter staffers explained  \"Some troll-like behavior is fun, good and humorous.  What we are talking  about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the  public conversation on Twitter particularly in communal areas like  conversations and search.\"</p><p>Those search bar changes aren't known to have impacted any Democrats.  The  spokesman for Donald Trump Jr. Andrew Sarabian claimed he was shadow- banned, too.  He tells Fox News, \"The targeted censorship of conservatives  on Twitter isn't some fringe conspiracy theory, it's actually happening.\"</p><p>Twitter insists \"Our behavioral ranking doesn't make judgments based on  political views or the substance of tweets.\"  Congressman Gaetz isn't so  sure.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I have been notified to have been shadow-banned -- myself, Mark Meadows,  Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.</p><p>DOOCY:  In 2017, a Twitter employee deactivated President Trump's account  because he didn't like his policies but it was live again 11 minutes later.  </p><p>These new accusations of bias may be probed for months.</p><p>GAETZ:  This is no different than if a billboard company were to make a  donation to my opponents and not the same donation to me, that would be an  illegal corporate contribution and we're reviewing our options to complain  to the Federal Elections Commission about the way Twitter has treated us.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY:  So much talk about social media here in Washington has been about  how the Russians used it to meddle in the last election.  But the alleged  interference being discussed today didn't originate at the Kremlin, it came  from California -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Peter Doocy reporting on Capitol Hill.  Peter -- thanks.</p><p>Conservative Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan wants to be the next speaker of  the house next year.  Jordan made the announcement last night and sent his  letter to colleagues today.  Jordan is a former chairman of the House  Freedom Caucus.  He faces likely competition from Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy and with Steve Scalise.  Current Speaker Paul Ryan is retiring at  the end of his term.</p><p>House Republicans are divided tonight over impeachment proceedings against  the number two official in the Justice Department.</p><p>Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge looks at both sides  tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Do I support impeachment of  Rod Rosenstein?  No, I do not.  </p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The House  Speaker characterized the articles of impeachment filed by the House  Freedom Caucus as an extreme step.  </p><p>RYAN:  I don't think we should be cavalier with this process or with this  term.  I don't think that this rises to the level of high crimes and  misdemeanors.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  Among the allegations: the deputy attorney general Rod  Rosenstein has a conflict of interest overseeing the Russia probe because  he signed the final surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter  Page based in part on the unverified Trump dossier.</p><p>Months earlier, the former British spy behind the dossier, Christopher  Steele, was fired by the FBI for lying.  Steele also admitted his hatred  for candidate Trump.  </p><p>According to the articles of impeachment, quote, \"Deputy attorney general  Rosenstein's failure to recuse himself in light of this inherent conflict  of interest constitutes dereliction of duty.\"  </p><p>GAETZ:  It was very frustrating to hear the speaker call our efforts  cavalier.  Christopher Steele lied to the FBI.  Rod Rosenstein knew that  and was so cavalier that he thought that his information was still a basis  to spy on people associated with the Trump campaign.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  Democrats claim the goal is discrediting special counsel Robert  Mueller's Russia probe.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Just when you think  you've seen it all, Republicans have no shame to go to a place where they  would undermine our judicial system.  </p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  If it's in the service of this  president, that's all they care about.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  A charge one key Republicans denies.  </p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), North Carolina:  I haven't discussed it with the  President and so I can tell you at this point who the President hires and  fires IS certainly not going to be influenced by something that this member  of congress does.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  In Boston the attorney general said house Republicans should  refocus and defended the department's number two.  </p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  My deputy, Rod Rosenstein, is highly  capable.  I have the highest confidence in him.  We need Congress to deal  with immigration questions.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  The Justice Department failed to provide the withheld records.   A Republican aide said tonight they have a commitment from leadership to  hold a vote on a contempt resolution after the recess in early September,  insisting impeachment remains on the table -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Catherine Herridge -- thanks very much.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>EMANUEL:  The Associated Press is reporting documents from a London-based  investigative unit indicate the Moscow lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr.  and is said to have promised the presidential campaign -- the Trump  presidential campaign -- dirt on Hillary Clinton, worked more closely with  Russian government officials than she previously let on.</p><p>The AP says the documents are from a company run by a Russian opposition  figure.  The documents reportedly paint a picture of Natalia Veselnitskaya  as a well-connected attorney who served as a ghost writer for top Russian  government lawyers and received assistance from senior interior ministry  personnel.  She has previously denied acting as representative of Russian  authorities.</p><p>Today is the deadline for the Trump administration to reunite children and  parents separated at the southern border during its zero-tolerance  enforcement.</p><p>Correspondent Casey Stegall tells us where things stand tonight from  Dallas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  More than a thousand reunions have  taken place and hundreds more have been approved ahead of today's deadline  to have all children back with their families after being separated at the  border.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I was sad.

Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us about a  new drug that might help slow the mental decline of Alzheimer's patients.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. KEITH FARGO, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION:  Potentially this is a  breakthrough drug.  </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The long and discouraging medical  quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is looking promising  thanks to newly released results from a large-scale clinical trial.  Phase  two test results for a new drug known as a BAN2401 were rolled out at the  Alzheimer's Association international conference in Chicago yesterday, and  it's setting in the medical community abuzz with hope.  </p><p>FARGO:  There is a great feeling of progress happening in the field, and  everyone was very excited to hear the release of these results.  </p><p>TURNER:  Preliminary results show BAN2401 may have the ability to  successfully attack both changes to the brain brought about by the growth  of plaque and the symptoms it causes.  There is currently no effective  treatment for Alzheimer's aside from a couple of medications that slow down  memory decline for a period of months.  </p><p>But according to the Alzheimer's Association, the global urgency to better  treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is higher than  ever and growing.  This disease is devastating for Americans, 5.7 million  currently live with it, and by 2,050 this number will rise to 14 million.   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a national plan  to address Alzheimer's disease that seeks to find a treatment by 2,025.   BAN2401 may be the most hopeful piece of that puzzle.  </p><p>FARGO:  If this pans out in larger studies, this is what we would call a  disease modifying drug, which is something the field does not yet have.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER:  Experts also caution there's still a very long road ahead and  probably years before BAN2401 gets approved for patients used.  The  Japanese company that developed the drug just recently submitted an FDA  request to initiate that approval process.  Until then someone in America  is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every 65 seconds.  Mike?</p><p>EMANUEL:  Gillian Turner reporting.  Gillian, thanks very much.</p><p>As Republicans accuse Twitter of shadow banning, we'll look at social media  politics.  The panel joins me when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  When people search on Twitter for an account  that they might want to follow, typically those search results auto  complete or auto fill in.  But if people were searching for me or other  prominent conservatives in the Congress, our accounts weren't coming up.   That was not the same treatment given to Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and  others on the left.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA:  It sound like a coincidence, kind of  like when you disagree with President Putin you have a heart attack?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Senator Kennedy always has a good line.  Then there was quite the  moment on the Internet when you had President Trump go after Twitter come  on Twitter.  \"Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.  We  will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many  complaints.\"  </p><p>Can Twitter live to fight another day?  Let's bring in our panel, Byron  York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Mollie  Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Mo Elleithee, executive  director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics.  OK, Byron, what do you  make of was there some shadow banning going on on Twitter?  </p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  It  appears there was.  I don't think there's any doubt that these big tech  companies do lean left.  There was a report in \"Vice\" that I think made a  pretty good case that there was shadow banning going on against Ronna  McDaniel, Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz you just saw, and others.  This was part  of Twitter's plan to encourage a healthy conversation.  The problem is  Twitter gets to decide what is healthy.  So I don't think it's really a  surprise.  It's kind of a continuation of what we see, infringement of  speech on college campuses.  People leave college campuses, they go work  for Twitter, and this is continued.  So I think it was probably a good idea  for the president to point this out and give it prominence.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  He was wrong when he  said it was illegal.  I don't know if we have any actual law that can be  cited that's actually illegal, but it's definitely a problem.  Twitter and  other social media companies that are restricting speech.  If you care  about the culture of speech, you want to make sure you have this free flow  of ideas. </p><p>And I think conservatives have been complaining about this, not just the  issue that was mentioned in the report of when you search for a name you  can't find it, but actual downplaying of conservatives and hiding what  conservatives are tweeting.  You are seeing this across different social  media platforms.  It's partly because they built algorithms that have the  bias built into it.  They privilege certain types of communication and  punish other types of communication.  It's a very frustrating experience.   You see a lot of people who want to control the discourse in regular media  and social media, and it actually leads to a lot of frustration among the  average population.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Here's more from Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz about this very  issue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I've been notified have been shadow banned, myself, Mark Meadows, Jim  Jordan, and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.  So I don't  know if that's the reason why we were supposedly inadvertently caught in  Twitters troll trap, but it seems very suspicious to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS:  First  I have to say as someone who works on a college campus that invites people  from both sides of the aisle, I couldn't let your comment about college  campuses go by without at least a subtle pushback.  </p><p>YORK:  I'll exclude yours.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I appreciate that.  </p><p>When Twitter announced back in May how they were going to go after  trolling, my initial thought when I read it is, OK, this is good.  Pushing  for more civil discourse on social media is a good thing.  Trying to push  back on those who are trying to disrupt conversation is a good thing.  But  I remember also thinking, they are going to get stuck here.  They're going  to catch the wrong people.  </p><p>And it seems that this is what is happening here.  The fact that Ronna  Romney McDaniel had this problem, but someone like an Alex Jones at Info  Wars didn't, that seems to be counterintuitive to what they are trying to  do.  Here's the problem.  These social media companies are trying to be  good citizens and encourage good debate and good conversation.  They are  trying to prevent themselves from being manipulated or being used as  organizing tools by hate groups or by foreign governments.  But at the same  time, they want to be platforms for free speech.  They are seeing it as a  challenge to do all of those things.  I applaud the effort for civil  discourse, but they have shown that they still have some work to do to  figure out how to do it right.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  OK, next issue, election security.  We expect a meeting tomorrow  at the White House.  Take a listen to this exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  We have got  to make sure that we have the right kind of information sharing with  states, with secretaries of states, and with anybody else that could see a  cyber from Russia.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  House Republicans refuse to  act for any oversight, any founding, because they are now more concerned  about covering up President Trump's activities than defending our democracy  from foreign attack.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  So here we are three plus months away from the next election.   How alarmed should we be, Mo?  </p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I think we should be alarmed.  I think every independent  analyst that has looked at our elections systems from a nonpartisan  perspective keeps pointing to holes in the systems and areas where we are  vulnerable.  And I would love to see our federal government in a bipartisan  way step forward.  I don't think any administration has done what it needed  to do in recent times.  Step forward and figure out how to plug those  holes.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  The strength of our system is actually how decentralized it is,  though.  This is very much a local and state issue.  If people care about  it they should tackle it at the local level.  The more you centralize  election systems the more vulnerable they are and the more valuable those  hacks become.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  You can give more support to the states, though, to do it.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  And we have known about this for a long time.  We're having  warnings right now, but we've had warnings for four years or more about  China trying to do the same thing.  So we should be on guard against many  foreign entities.  </p><p>YORK:  This White House meeting, if only for the optics and P.R. of this,  they should have had this a long time ago.  The midterms are less than 100  days away, and we've had so many accusations that the Trump administration  has done nothing to try to stop Russian and other foreign meddling in these  upcoming elections when in fact some of these intelligence agencies  apparently have been working on this but they won't talk about it.  So some  sort of public sign that the president and the government are actually  doing something is really overdue.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Something I would like to get to quickly is the race for House  speaker for the next Congress is heating up.  Here we are about 100 days  out.  What do you make of it, Byron?  </p><p>YORK:  I think you are seeing with the entry of Jim Jordan in the race, I  think you're seeing the same dynamics that have driven Republicans in the  House crazy, the same dynamic that drove John Boehner crazy, and the same  dynamic that has drove Paul Ryan crazy is now showing up again, which is a  group of 40 or 50 really conservative Republicans disagreeing with the rest  of the party on a lot of key issues.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I think it's just a healthy thing when you have races that are  contested and it helps you understand more about the caucus.  Kevin  McCarthy is the clear frontrunner.  You have a Freedom Caucus candidate who  has thrown his hat in the right, and you might see someone from the left  also enter the ring.  In general, I think these are healthy things.  You  get to learn more about what issues the Republican caucus cares about, and  that will help whoever is the eventual leader know how to manage the  caucus.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I think a lot of Democrats are excited to see this race between  McCarthy and Jordan play out.  A lot of it is going to depend on what  happens in November and whether this is a race for speaker or a race for  minority leader.  And if Democrats win back the House I will be curious to  see at what expense.  When Republicans won back the house it was at the  expense of a lot of moderate Democrats.  The caucus got then moved to the  left.  If Democrats win back the House, is it by defeating a lot of freedom  caucus type of candidates or more moderate candidates, and that will define  this race.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  All right, we have to leave it there.  Next up, the president  takes a victory lap after his trade deal.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have to say because we  have a lot of farmers in this place, we had this hat made up.  Look at  that, it's John Deere colors actually, but make our farmer great again.   Isn't that great?</p><p>These are incredible people, and you know we have given them a little help  yesterday.  We are giving them help.  And everybody is going to be back  because we have the greatest farms in the world.  </p><p>STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout.  This is a  reciprocal role -- again, we want free and fair reciprocal trade, and  that's what we're fighting for.  </p><p>To the extent people use political issues to target our farmers, the  president will stand up for them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Some of the latest talk on trade, and tomorrow we've expecting  GDP numbers.  And the president gave us a heck of a tease.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will only get better.   Our numbers are fantastic right now.  You're going to see on Friday what  happens with GPD.  A lot of predictions, a lot of predictions.  I told you  before, some with a five in front of it.  There were predictions frm 3.8 to  5.3.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  It's 3.8 to 5.3, and we are back with our panel, Byron, Mollie,  and Mo.  Where are we, Byron, on the economy, on these tariffs?  </p><p>YORK:  I think the biggest economic news of the week could be coming  tomorrow.  Larry Kudlow came out and all but predicted economic growth for  the second quarter at four percent or higher.  And if you get four percent  economic growth, if you think the president has bragged about the economy  before, you just wait until there's actual four percent growth in the  economy.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I also think the news we got yesterday about the E.U. moving  towards low tariffs or no tariffs with the U.S. is significant news.  We've  had so much criticism of the Trump administration's tariff policy.  People  say high tariffs are a really bad thing.  The Trump administration, not  just President Trump, but you saw this in last night's interview with  Wilbur Ross said the strategy is to get to low tariffs.  We've had this  post-World War II order that saw the ratcheting up of tariffs.  Partly that  was our desire to help a bunch of more ravaged countries after World War II  build up their economy.  They don't quite need that now.  Some of them are  powerhouses themselves.  So if you want to renegotiate this, you can't just  ask for it.  You actually have to threaten it.  That's the Trump  administration approach here, and their strategy might be paying off.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Here is the president talking about what he has worked out with  the E.U.  Take a listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We opened up Europe, and  that's going to be a great thing for Europe and it's really going to be a  great thing for us.  And it's going to be a really great thing for our  farmers because you have just got yourself one big market that really  essentially -- wouldn't you say it never existed, because you just had a  problem.  So we did that yesterday afternoon.  We signed a letter of  intent, or agreed to a letter of intent, and we are starting the documents,  but the relationship is very, very good.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  All right, Mo, so where are we on trade and tariffs?  </p><p>ELLEITHEE:  First of all, if I'm correct, the United States was already the  greatest exporter of soybeans to Europe, so saying that market wasn't there  before is a little off.  I will be curious to see what happens here.  It  feels like we have been here before where it wasn't that long ago that the  administration announced a major breakthrough with China when it came to  trade negotiations, and it was going to be great for us, and then it fell  apart.  </p><p>And what we've got is a commitment for a conversation.  I'm always for  conversation, I'm always for negotiation.  We'll see how that plays.  But  we haven't seen any details yet, we haven't seen any super strong  commitment yet.  And on a lot of goods, like steel and like aluminum, those  tariffs are still in place, and we see -- I know the package talked about  one anecdote with one company that was bringing back jobs, but there are  lots of anecdotes about companies that are still losing jobs as a result of  these tariffs and costs going up.  So I think we should encourage the  negotiations, but we are not there yet.  </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  One of the tweets that President Trump had earlier this week  that I thought was interesting is when he complained that people were  snipping at his heels and that it was difficult to negotiate when you have  all this criticism.  I took that to mean that he was trying to tell people  if you want to get to lower tariffs, you have to play the game here.  And  to have all this opposition and not figure out what the U.S. is trying to  do in taking on some huge structural problems with China but also with  other countries where you have regulatory barriers that prevent American  companies from selling their products in different places, or intellectual  property theft or really high tariffs.  </p><p>If you think the status quo is fine, you are opposed to the Trump  administration doing anything.  If you don't think the status quo is fine,  you should be thinking about how to help get to this eventual goal of the  Trump administration of lower tariffs.  They keep saying it.  Trump said it  in Canada, he'd like to move to no tariffs, no barriers.  If you are a free  marketer, if you like that, you should probably figure out what's going on  here.  </p><p>YORK:  The big news yesterday was not that they reach the agreement to get  there.  It was that they reached an agreement to stop going in the wrong  direction, which I think, just stop the threatening and the fighting is  probably a good idea.  Some of the tariffs are in place already and have  not been taken up.  But so much of this hysteria about this has been over  tariffs that were planned or threatened but are not in effect.  So if you  can just kind of stopped that and move, as Mollie said, toward a lower  tariff world, maybe Trump has had a good idea.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  I can tell you that a bunch of Republican heads nearly blew up  when there was talk about a $12 billion bailout to American farmers, so  we'll see where it goes from here.  </p><p>When we come back, an incredible success story about socks.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Finally tonight, a really feel-good story.  A lot of hard work  has paid off for a 22-year-old fine young man with Down syndrome.  The  socket company he founded alongside his dad is now worth $4 million.  After  just a year and a half, John's Crazy Socks has created 35 jobs and raise  around $135,000 for its charity partners.  John designs the socks himself  and fills the orders.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  John had worn crazy socks his whole life, that was his  thing.  </p><p>What's our mission?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our mission is to spread happiness.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  And John filled some pretty important borders.  Former president  George Herbert Walker Bush is a fan.  John has been exchanging socks with  Mr. Bush for the past year or so.  And I've got to tell you, I love the  story so much, I went on the website and I ordered some socks for myself  today.  I love a good pair of crazy sock, and you can see some of the  former president's fun socks there, Superman, and some other fun stuff.  </p><p>That's it for this edition of SPECIAL REPORT.  I'm Mike Emanuel in  Washington.  \"The Story\" with guest host Sandra Smith starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome to Washington.  I'm Mike Emanuel in for  Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump is right now on his way back to Washington after two  Midwestern stops conveniently-timed for the day after he reached a major  agreement with Europe over trade and tariffs.  While the President is  assuring that better trade times are ahead, not everyone is so sure.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight from the White House.  Good  evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Evening -- Mike.</p><p>The President's tough trade tactics are working, say White House officials,  at least to bring our trading partners to the bargaining table.  But they  also quickly acknowledge that there is a fair amount of anxiety among some  companies and businesses that are afraid they will be caught in the  crossfire.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  -- there are a lot of  farmers in this place.  We had this hat made up.  Look at that.  It's the  John Deere colors actually.  Make our farmers great again.  Isn't that  great.</p><p>CORKE:  Fresh off yesterday's announced framework to improve trade with the  European Union, President Trump today looked to build on that momentum with  a trip to America's heartland.  Mr. Trump using a stop in Dubuque to calm  tariff concerns among Iowa farmers who collectively export a third of the  soybeans that they produce.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Basically we opened up Europe and it's going to be a great thing  for Europe and it's really going to be a great thing for us.  And it's  going to be a really great thing for our farmers because you have just  gotten yourself one big market that really essentially, wouldn't you say,  Kim, never existed because you just had -- you just had a problem.  </p><p>CORKE:  On Twitter Mr. Trump drilled down boasting that \"The E.U. would  start buy soybeans from our great farmers immediately.  His visit to Iowa  and later Illinois comes two days after Mr. Trump announced that his  administration would direct $12 billion to farmers who have been hurt by  tariffs, a plan critics called a bailout, a charge forcefully rejected by  White House officials.  </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout -- this is  reciprocal.  Again -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where will it come from?  </p><p>MNUCHIN:  -- we want free and fair reciprocal trade and that's what we are  fighting for.  </p><p>CORKE:  However, the President's trade agenda has netted mixed results so  far.  Retaliatory tariffs have strained talks with both China and Canada  although there has been steady progress on a new trade deal with Mexico and  now a promising breakthrough with the E.U., the latter of which was met  with a cautious optimism on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISINA:  When you negotiate, there's a chance  that you're not going to win but you can't make progress sometimes without  negotiating and I think that's where we are in the middle of.  </p><p>SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  Well, you know, any time that we  can sit down and start working through the differences, you know, that's --  everyone has a different style but if we can have the end result, we end up  with this fair trade -- I want free and fair trade.  </p><p>CORKE:  But progress is slow and that's particularly the case with  America's largest, single trading partner China, which has intentionally  targeted industries and crops in the Midwest with higher fees in  retaliation for new U.S. tariffs designed to level the trade playing field  -- a subject of great interest at today's Senate Appropriations Committee  hearing.  </p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  If your conclusion is that  China is taking over all of our technology and the future of our children - - it's a stupid (ph) fight, then you are right.  We should capitulate.  My  view is, that's how we got where we are.  I don't think it's a stupid  fight.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Mike -- the U.S. has already slapped about $50 billion in tariffs  on Chinese products with the President threatening to slap another $200  billion on China if they don't back off on tariffs and obviously taking  advantage of our intellectual property -- Mike.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Something to watch there.  </p><p>Now, Kevin -- there's an important meeting taking place at the White House  tomorrow on election security -- what can you tell us about it?  </p><p>CORKE:  Yes, spot on.  The President will chair that meeting of his  national security team.  We are talking about Vice President Mike Pence,  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  And obviously John Bolton, his national  security advisor and others will be here to talk about the importance of  safety and security of our electoral system.</p><p>You heard Kirstjen Nielsen tell Fox News just yesterday, the Homeland  Security Secretary we recognize that Russia meddled in that 2016 campaign,  they possess the capability, Mike, to do it again in 2018 underscoring the  need for the big meeting here tomorrow -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  A huge story tomorrow and in the months ahead.</p><p>Kevin Corke, live at the White House.  Kevin -- many thanks.</p><p>Stocks were mixed as social media giant Facebook took a major hit today.   The Dow gained 113, the S&amp;P 500 was off seven, Nasdaq dropped 80.</p><p>Now, let's examine the short term and long term effects of the European  trade deal and the fall of Facebook on Wall Street today.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton of Fox Business Network joins us live from New York.  Good  evening -- Deirdre.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good evening -- Mike.</p><p>Well, Facebook's $119 billion plus route -- one of the single, biggest  losses in stock market history for any one stock -- is definitely  Facebook's worst day ever by far.  So the stock plunged at 19 percent; it  closed near that level.  So the company missed quarterly revenue forecast,  it lowered its outlook and it said its revenue growth rate will slow.</p><p>Some investors are worried that while Facebook's user growth is stalling,  it's spending more.  The company committed to investing billions of dollars  per year on developing stronger privacy measures.  The company has faced  bruising headlines about its role in enabling fake news and election  meddling so some see these decisions as necessary.</p><p>Optimists say Facebook has more than two billion global users, it will  figure out its next best steps.  One contextual point, the company's  previous worst single day performance, you have to go back to July 2012.   The stock fell more than 11.5 percent at that time.  The company and  pivoted to selling mobile advertising and investors doubted that strategy.   Now it makes up 91 percent of the company's ad revenue.</p><p>But no matter what the future holds, today's drop sent founder and CEO Mark  Zuckerberg's personal net worth plummeting by more than $11 billion --  Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Ok.  So that's something we'll be watching Deirdre.</p><p>But from the negative to the positive -- what are the short term and long  term effects of this European trade deal?</p><p>BOLTON:  So President Trump -- his meeting with the E.C. president Jean- Claude Juncker put a pause in an escalating trade war, so that's a bright  spot.  Europe says it's going to buy more American soybeans and more  American liquid natural gas.</p><p>Soybeans are the U.S.'s biggest agri export and buying with more from  Europe is going to counter what China is not buying.  If Europe buys more  American liquid natural gas, it could be a win-win for both regions.   Analysts say the U.S. could become the world's biggest supplier of liquid  natural gas in the next five years which would equal U.S. job creation.</p><p>For Europe the win is decreasing its dependence on Russia.  Russia has a 35  percent market share as a gas supplier in Europe and Russia is  unpredictable.  It cut off pipelines in Eastern Europe in 2006, again in  2007 and '08 and again in 2014 with harsh winter conditions.  There were  casualties.  Some experts say Russia uses its natural gas supply as a  weapon.</p><p>The business question though for American liquid natural gas suppliers is  that they can sell at higher prices in Asia because Chinese manufacturing  is on fire.  So those company heads will have some big decisions ahead. </p><p>Mike -- back to you.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Deirdre Bolton from Fox Business -- thanks very much.</p><p>BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Republicans are going after Twitter tonight.  They say the social  media giant has purposely kept some of them from appearing in search  results.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy reports on what some consider the latest example  of ideological censorship from the left.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Congressman Matt Gaetz is one of the  Republicans whose Twitter handle was hidden for months from some curious  users searching for him.  Type his name and he didn't pop up.</p><p>Today the President whose Twitter account helped get him elected wrote,  \"Twitter shadow-banning prominent Republicans -- not good.  We will look  into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many complaints.\"</p><p>Another one of the allegedly blocked Republicans RNC chair Ronna McDaniel.  </p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESWOMAN:  It took a tweet from the President of  the United States to get Twitter to care about every day Republican voters.   That's very troubling.</p><p>DOOCY:  The conservative shadow-ban appears to have been fixed this morning  for the first time since May when Twitter announced it would crackdown on  trolls contributing to an unhealthy dialogue and Twitter staffers explained  \"Some troll-like behavior is fun, good and humorous.  What we are talking  about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the  public conversation on Twitter particularly in communal areas like  conversations and search.\"</p><p>Those search bar changes aren't known to have impacted any Democrats.  The  spokesman for Donald Trump Jr. Andrew Sarabian claimed he was shadow- banned, too.  He tells Fox News, \"The targeted censorship of conservatives  on Twitter isn't some fringe conspiracy theory, it's actually happening.\"</p><p>Twitter insists \"Our behavioral ranking doesn't make judgments based on  political views or the substance of tweets.\"  Congressman Gaetz isn't so  sure.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I have been notified to have been shadow-banned -- myself, Mark Meadows,  Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.</p><p>DOOCY:  In 2017, a Twitter employee deactivated President Trump's account  because he didn't like his policies but it was live again 11 minutes later.  </p><p>These new accusations of bias may be probed for months.</p><p>GAETZ:  This is no different than if a billboard company were to make a  donation to my opponents and not the same donation to me, that would be an  illegal corporate contribution and we're reviewing our options to complain  to the Federal Elections Commission about the way Twitter has treated us.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY:  So much talk about social media here in Washington has been about  how the Russians used it to meddle in the last election.

PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Do I support impeachment of  Rod Rosenstein?  No, I do not.  </p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The House  Speaker characterized the articles of impeachment filed by the House  Freedom Caucus as an extreme step.  </p><p>RYAN:  I don't think we should be cavalier with this process or with this  term.  I don't think that this rises to the level of high crimes and  misdemeanors.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  Among the allegations: the deputy attorney general Rod  Rosenstein has a conflict of interest overseeing the Russia probe because  he signed the final surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter  Page based in part on the unverified Trump dossier.</p><p>Months earlier, the former British spy behind the dossier, Christopher  Steele, was fired by the FBI for lying.  Steele also admitted his hatred  for candidate Trump.  </p><p>According to the articles of impeachment, quote, \"Deputy attorney general  Rosenstein's failure to recuse himself in light of this inherent conflict  of interest constitutes dereliction of duty.\"  </p><p>GAETZ:  It was very frustrating to hear the speaker call our efforts  cavalier.  Christopher Steele lied to the FBI.  Rod Rosenstein knew that  and was so cavalier that he thought that his information was still a basis  to spy on people associated with the Trump campaign.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  Democrats claim the goal is discrediting special counsel Robert  Mueller's Russia probe.  </p><p>REP.

So when they say they are going to meet the deadlines it's only  for those individuals they declared to be eligible for reunification by the  deadline.  </p><p>STEGALL:  He is referring to the more than 900 children that the government  puts into the ineligible category.  According to court documents, more than  450 involve a parent who has already been deported.  </p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  So these are parents  who have made the decision not to bring the children with them and then  will continue to work with the court to understand how we can best comply  with the order.  </p><p>STEGALL:  The ACLU and other immigration lawyers claim some of the people  left without their kids because they may have been misled by federal  officials.  </p><p>ROBERT LOPEZ, TEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT:  It's going to be difficult for  parents who are in a different country and, you know, may not know how to  navigate the OR, the Office of Refugee Resettlement System.  </p><p>STEGALL:  U.S. district judge Dana Sombra did admonish the Department of  Justice for separating families without a plan in place, saying it quote,  \"lacked forethought with regard to keeping track of people\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEGALL:  Both sides will be back in court tomorrow updating the judge on  final numbers and to provide a status update on its continued efforts,  despite the deadline then being officially up -- Mike.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Casey Stegall, live in Dallas on this important immigration  issue.

Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us about a  new drug that might help slow the mental decline of Alzheimer's patients.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. KEITH FARGO, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION:  Potentially this is a  breakthrough drug.  </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The long and discouraging medical  quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is looking promising  thanks to newly released results from a large-scale clinical trial.  Phase  two test results for a new drug known as a BAN2401 were rolled out at the  Alzheimer's Association international conference in Chicago yesterday, and  it's setting in the medical community abuzz with hope.  </p><p>FARGO:  There is a great feeling of progress happening in the field, and  everyone was very excited to hear the release of these results.  </p><p>TURNER:  Preliminary results show BAN2401 may have the ability to  successfully attack both changes to the brain brought about by the growth  of plaque and the symptoms it causes.  There is currently no effective  treatment for Alzheimer's aside from a couple of medications that slow down  memory decline for a period of months.  </p><p>But according to the Alzheimer's Association, the global urgency to better  treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is higher than  ever and growing.  This disease is devastating for Americans, 5.7 million  currently live with it, and by 2,050 this number will rise to 14 million.   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a national plan  to address Alzheimer's disease that seeks to find a treatment by 2,025.   BAN2401 may be the most hopeful piece of that puzzle.  </p><p>FARGO:  If this pans out in larger studies, this is what we would call a  disease modifying drug, which is something the field does not yet have.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER:  Experts also caution there's still a very long road ahead and  probably years before BAN2401 gets approved for patients used.  The  Japanese company that developed the drug just recently submitted an FDA  request to initiate that approval process.  Until then someone in America  is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every 65 seconds.  Mike?</p><p>EMANUEL:  Gillian Turner reporting.  Gillian, thanks very much.</p><p>As Republicans accuse Twitter of shadow banning, we'll look at social media  politics.  The panel joins me when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  When people search on Twitter for an account  that they might want to follow, typically those search results auto  complete or auto fill in.  But if people were searching for me or other  prominent conservatives in the Congress, our accounts weren't coming up.   That was not the same treatment given to Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and  others on the left.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA:  It sound like a coincidence, kind of  like when you disagree with President Putin you have a heart attack?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Senator Kennedy always has a good line.  Then there was quite the  moment on the Internet when you had President Trump go after Twitter come  on Twitter.  \"Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.  We  will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many  complaints.\"  </p><p>Can Twitter live to fight another day?  Let's bring in our panel, Byron  York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Mollie  Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Mo Elleithee, executive  director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics.  OK, Byron, what do you  make of was there some shadow banning going on on Twitter?  </p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  It  appears there was.  I don't think there's any doubt that these big tech  companies do lean left.  There was a report in \"Vice\" that I think made a  pretty good case that there was shadow banning going on against Ronna  McDaniel, Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz you just saw, and others.  This was part  of Twitter's plan to encourage a healthy conversation.  The problem is  Twitter gets to decide what is healthy.  So I don't think it's really a  surprise.  It's kind of a continuation of what we see, infringement of  speech on college campuses.  People leave college campuses, they go work  for Twitter, and this is continued.  So I think it was probably a good idea  for the president to point this out and give it prominence.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  He was wrong when he  said it was illegal.  I don't know if we have any actual law that can be  cited that's actually illegal, but it's definitely a problem.  Twitter and  other social media companies that are restricting speech.  If you care  about the culture of speech, you want to make sure you have this free flow  of ideas. </p><p>And I think conservatives have been complaining about this, not just the  issue that was mentioned in the report of when you search for a name you  can't find it, but actual downplaying of conservatives and hiding what  conservatives are tweeting.  You are seeing this across different social  media platforms.  It's partly because they built algorithms that have the  bias built into it.  They privilege certain types of communication and  punish other types of communication.  It's a very frustrating experience.   You see a lot of people who want to control the discourse in regular media  and social media, and it actually leads to a lot of frustration among the  average population.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Here's more from Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz about this very  issue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I've been notified have been shadow banned, myself, Mark Meadows, Jim  Jordan, and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.  So I don't  know if that's the reason why we were supposedly inadvertently caught in  Twitters troll trap, but it seems very suspicious to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS:  First  I have to say as someone who works on a college campus that invites people  from both sides of the aisle, I couldn't let your comment about college  campuses go by without at least a subtle pushback.  </p><p>YORK:  I'll exclude yours.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I appreciate that.  </p><p>When Twitter announced back in May how they were going to go after  trolling, my initial thought when I read it is, OK, this is good.  Pushing  for more civil discourse on social media is a good thing.  Trying to push  back on those who are trying to disrupt conversation is a good thing.  But  I remember also thinking, they are going to get stuck here.  They're going  to catch the wrong people.  </p><p>And it seems that this is what is happening here.  The fact that Ronna  Romney McDaniel had this problem, but someone like an Alex Jones at Info  Wars didn't, that seems to be counterintuitive to what they are trying to  do.  Here's the problem.  These social media companies are trying to be  good citizens and encourage good debate and good conversation.  They are  trying to prevent themselves from being manipulated or being used as  organizing tools by hate groups or by foreign governments.  But at the same  time, they want to be platforms for free speech.  They are seeing it as a  challenge to do all of those things.  I applaud the effort for civil  discourse, but they have shown that they still have some work to do to  figure out how to do it right.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  OK, next issue, election security.  We expect a meeting tomorrow  at the White House.  Take a listen to this exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  We have got  to make sure that we have the right kind of information sharing with  states, with secretaries of states, and with anybody else that could see a  cyber from Russia.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  House Republicans refuse to  act for any oversight, any founding, because they are now more concerned  about covering up President Trump's activities than defending our democracy  from foreign attack.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  So here we are three plus months away from the next election.   How alarmed should we be, Mo?  </p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I think we should be alarmed.  I think every independent  analyst that has looked at our elections systems from a nonpartisan  perspective keeps pointing to holes in the systems and areas where we are  vulnerable.  And I would love to see our federal government in a bipartisan  way step forward.  I don't think any administration has done what it needed  to do in recent times.  Step forward and figure out how to plug those  holes.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  The strength of our system is actually how decentralized it is,  though.  This is very much a local and state issue.  If people care about  it they should tackle it at the local level.  The more you centralize  election systems the more vulnerable they are and the more valuable those  hacks become.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  You can give more support to the states, though, to do it.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  And we have known about this for a long time.  We're having  warnings right now, but we've had warnings for four years or more about  China trying to do the same thing.  So we should be on guard against many  foreign entities.  </p><p>YORK:  This White House meeting, if only for the optics and P.R. of this,  they should have had this a long time ago.  The midterms are less than 100  days away, and we've had so many accusations that the Trump administration  has done nothing to try to stop Russian and other foreign meddling in these  upcoming elections when in fact some of these intelligence agencies  apparently have been working on this but they won't talk about it.  So some  sort of public sign that the president and the government are actually  doing something is really overdue.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Something I would like to get to quickly is the race for House  speaker for the next Congress is heating up.  Here we are about 100 days  out.  What do you make of it, Byron?  </p><p>YORK:  I think you are seeing with the entry of Jim Jordan in the race, I  think you're seeing the same dynamics that have driven Republicans in the  House crazy, the same dynamic that drove John Boehner crazy, and the same  dynamic that has drove Paul Ryan crazy is now showing up again, which is a  group of 40 or 50 really conservative Republicans disagreeing with the rest  of the party on a lot of key issues.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I think it's just a healthy thing when you have races that are  contested and it helps you understand more about the caucus.  Kevin  McCarthy is the clear frontrunner.  You have a Freedom Caucus candidate who  has thrown his hat in the right, and you might see someone from the left  also enter the ring.  In general, I think these are healthy things.  You  get to learn more about what issues the Republican caucus cares about, and  that will help whoever is the eventual leader know how to manage the  caucus.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I think a lot of Democrats are excited to see this race between  McCarthy and Jordan play out.  A lot of it is going to depend on what  happens in November and whether this is a race for speaker or a race for  minority leader.  And if Democrats win back the House I will be curious to  see at what expense.  When Republicans won back the house it was at the  expense of a lot of moderate Democrats.  The caucus got then moved to the  left.  If Democrats win back the House, is it by defeating a lot of freedom  caucus type of candidates or more moderate candidates, and that will define  this race.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  All right, we have to leave it there.  Next up, the president  takes a victory lap after his trade deal.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have to say because we  have a lot of farmers in this place, we had this hat made up.  Look at  that, it's John Deere colors actually, but make our farmer great again.   Isn't that great?</p><p>These are incredible people, and you know we have given them a little help  yesterday.  We are giving them help.  And everybody is going to be back  because we have the greatest farms in the world.  </p><p>STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout.  This is a  reciprocal role -- again, we want free and fair reciprocal trade, and  that's what we're fighting for.  </p><p>To the extent people use political issues to target our farmers, the  president will stand up for them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Some of the latest talk on trade, and tomorrow we've expecting  GDP numbers.  And the president gave us a heck of a tease.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will only get better.   Our numbers are fantastic right now.  You're going to see on Friday what  happens with GPD.  A lot of predictions, a lot of predictions.  I told you  before, some with a five in front of it.  There were predictions frm 3.8 to  5.3.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  It's 3.8 to 5.3, and we are back with our panel, Byron, Mollie,  and Mo.  Where are we, Byron, on the economy, on these tariffs?  </p><p>YORK:  I think the biggest economic news of the week could be coming  tomorrow.  Larry Kudlow came out and all but predicted economic growth for  the second quarter at four percent or higher.  And if you get four percent  economic growth, if you think the president has bragged about the economy  before, you just wait until there's actual four percent growth in the  economy.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I also think the news we got yesterday about the E.U. moving  towards low tariffs or no tariffs with the U.S. is significant news.  We've  had so much criticism of the Trump administration's tariff policy.  People  say high tariffs are a really bad thing.  The Trump administration, not  just President Trump, but you saw this in last night's interview with  Wilbur Ross said the strategy is to get to low tariffs.  We've had this  post-World War II order that saw the ratcheting up of tariffs.  Partly that  was our desire to help a bunch of more ravaged countries after World War II  build up their economy.  They don't quite need that now.  Some of them are  powerhouses themselves.  So if you want to renegotiate this, you can't just  ask for it.  You actually have to threaten it.  That's the Trump  administration approach here, and their strategy might be paying off.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Here is the president talking about what he has worked out with  the E.U.  Take a listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We opened up Europe, and  that's going to be a great thing for Europe and it's really going to be a  great thing for us.  And it's going to be a really great thing for our  farmers because you have just got yourself one big market that really  essentially -- wouldn't you say it never existed, because you just had a  problem.  So we did that yesterday afternoon.  We signed a letter of  intent, or agreed to a letter of intent, and we are starting the documents,  but the relationship is very, very good.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  All right, Mo, so where are we on trade and tariffs?  </p><p>ELLEITHEE:  First of all, if I'm correct, the United States was already the  greatest exporter of soybeans to Europe, so saying that market wasn't there  before is a little off.  I will be curious to see what happens here.  It  feels like we have been here before where it wasn't that long ago that the  administration announced a major breakthrough with China when it came to  trade negotiations, and it was going to be great for us, and then it fell  apart.  </p><p>And what we've got is a commitment for a conversation.  I'm always for  conversation, I'm always for negotiation.  We'll see how that plays.  But  we haven't seen any details yet, we haven't seen any super strong  commitment yet.  And on a lot of goods, like steel and like aluminum, those  tariffs are still in place, and we see -- I know the package talked about  one anecdote with one company that was bringing back jobs, but there are  lots of anecdotes about companies that are still losing jobs as a result of  these tariffs and costs going up.  So I think we should encourage the  negotiations, but we are not there yet.  </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  One of the tweets that President Trump had earlier this week  that I thought was interesting is when he complained that people were  snipping at his heels and that it was difficult to negotiate when you have  all this criticism.  I took that to mean that he was trying to tell people  if you want to get to lower tariffs, you have to play the game here.  And  to have all this opposition and not figure out what the U.S. is trying to  do in taking on some huge structural problems with China but also with  other countries where you have regulatory barriers that prevent American  companies from selling their products in different places, or intellectual  property theft or really high tariffs.  </p><p>If you think the status quo is fine, you are opposed to the Trump  administration doing anything.  If you don't think the status quo is fine,  you should be thinking about how to help get to this eventual goal of the  Trump administration of lower tariffs.  They keep saying it.  Trump said it  in Canada, he'd like to move to no tariffs, no barriers.  If you are a free  marketer, if you like that, you should probably figure out what's going on  here.  </p><p>YORK:  The big news yesterday was not that they reach the agreement to get  there.  It was that they reached an agreement to stop going in the wrong  direction, which I think, just stop the threatening and the fighting is  probably a good idea.  Some of the tariffs are in place already and have  not been taken up.  But so much of this hysteria about this has been over  tariffs that were planned or threatened but are not in effect.  So if you  can just kind of stopped that and move, as Mollie said, toward a lower  tariff world, maybe Trump has had a good idea.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  I can tell you that a bunch of Republican heads nearly blew up  when there was talk about a $12 billion bailout to American farmers, so  we'll see where it goes from here.  </p><p>When we come back, an incredible success story about socks.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Finally tonight, a really feel-good story.  A lot of hard work  has paid off for a 22-year-old fine young man with Down syndrome.  The  socket company he founded alongside his dad is now worth $4 million.  After  just a year and a half, John's Crazy Socks has created 35 jobs and raise  around $135,000 for its charity partners.  John designs the socks himself  and fills the orders.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  John had worn crazy socks his whole life, that was his  thing.  </p><p>What's our mission?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our mission is to spread happiness.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  And John filled some pretty important borders.  Former president  George Herbert Walker Bush is a fan.  John has been exchanging socks with  Mr. Bush for the past year or so.  And I've got to tell you, I love the  story so much, I went on the website and I ordered some socks for myself  today.  I love a good pair of crazy sock, and you can see some of the  former president's fun socks there, Superman, and some other fun stuff.  </p><p>That's it for this edition of SPECIAL REPORT.  I'm Mike Emanuel in  Washington.  \"The Story\" with guest host Sandra Smith starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

Welcome to Washington.  I'm Mike Emanuel in for  Bret Baier.</p><p>President Trump is right now on his way back to Washington after two  Midwestern stops conveniently-timed for the day after he reached a major  agreement with Europe over trade and tariffs.  While the President is  assuring that better trade times are ahead, not everyone is so sure.</p><p>Correspondent Kevin Corke starts us off tonight from the White House.  Good  evening -- Kevin.</p><p>KEVIN CORKE, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Evening -- Mike.</p><p>The President's tough trade tactics are working, say White House officials,  at least to bring our trading partners to the bargaining table.  But they  also quickly acknowledge that there is a fair amount of anxiety among some  companies and businesses that are afraid they will be caught in the  crossfire.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  -- there are a lot of  farmers in this place.  We had this hat made up.  Look at that.  It's the  John Deere colors actually.  Make our farmers great again.  Isn't that  great.</p><p>CORKE:  Fresh off yesterday's announced framework to improve trade with the  European Union, President Trump today looked to build on that momentum with  a trip to America's heartland.  Mr. Trump using a stop in Dubuque to calm  tariff concerns among Iowa farmers who collectively export a third of the  soybeans that they produce.  </p><p>TRUMP:  Basically we opened up Europe and it's going to be a great thing  for Europe and it's really going to be a great thing for us.  And it's  going to be a really great thing for our farmers because you have just  gotten yourself one big market that really essentially, wouldn't you say,  Kim, never existed because you just had -- you just had a problem.  </p><p>CORKE:  On Twitter Mr. Trump drilled down boasting that \"The E.U. would  start buy soybeans from our great farmers immediately.  His visit to Iowa  and later Illinois comes two days after Mr. Trump announced that his  administration would direct $12 billion to farmers who have been hurt by  tariffs, a plan critics called a bailout, a charge forcefully rejected by  White House officials.  </p><p>STEVEN MNUCHIN, U.S. TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout -- this is  reciprocal.  Again -- </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Where will it come from?  </p><p>MNUCHIN:  -- we want free and fair reciprocal trade and that's what we are  fighting for.  </p><p>CORKE:  However, the President's trade agenda has netted mixed results so  far.  Retaliatory tariffs have strained talks with both China and Canada  although there has been steady progress on a new trade deal with Mexico and  now a promising breakthrough with the E.U., the latter of which was met  with a cautious optimism on Capitol Hill.  </p><p>SENATOR JOHN KENNEDY (R), LOUISINA:  When you negotiate, there's a chance  that you're not going to win but you can't make progress sometimes without  negotiating and I think that's where we are in the middle of.  </p><p>SENATOR JOE MANCHIN (D), WEST VIRGINIA:  Well, you know, any time that we  can sit down and start working through the differences, you know, that's --  everyone has a different style but if we can have the end result, we end up  with this fair trade -- I want free and fair trade.  </p><p>CORKE:  But progress is slow and that's particularly the case with  America's largest, single trading partner China, which has intentionally  targeted industries and crops in the Midwest with higher fees in  retaliation for new U.S. tariffs designed to level the trade playing field  -- a subject of great interest at today's Senate Appropriations Committee  hearing.  </p><p>ROBERT LIGHTHIZER, U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE:  If your conclusion is that  China is taking over all of our technology and the future of our children - - it's a stupid (ph) fight, then you are right.  We should capitulate.  My  view is, that's how we got where we are.  I don't think it's a stupid  fight.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CORKE:  Mike -- the U.S. has already slapped about $50 billion in tariffs  on Chinese products with the President threatening to slap another $200  billion on China if they don't back off on tariffs and obviously taking  advantage of our intellectual property -- Mike.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Something to watch there.  </p><p>Now, Kevin -- there's an important meeting taking place at the White House  tomorrow on election security -- what can you tell us about it?  </p><p>CORKE:  Yes, spot on.  The President will chair that meeting of his  national security team.  We are talking about Vice President Mike Pence,  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.  And obviously John Bolton, his national  security advisor and others will be here to talk about the importance of  safety and security of our electoral system.</p><p>You heard Kirstjen Nielsen tell Fox News just yesterday, the Homeland  Security Secretary we recognize that Russia meddled in that 2016 campaign,  they possess the capability, Mike, to do it again in 2018 underscoring the  need for the big meeting here tomorrow -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  A huge story tomorrow and in the months ahead.</p><p>Kevin Corke, live at the White House.  Kevin -- many thanks.</p><p>Stocks were mixed as social media giant Facebook took a major hit today.   The Dow gained 113, the S&amp;P 500 was off seven, Nasdaq dropped 80.</p><p>Now, let's examine the short term and long term effects of the European  trade deal and the fall of Facebook on Wall Street today.</p><p>Deirdre Bolton of Fox Business Network joins us live from New York.  Good  evening -- Deirdre.  </p><p>DEIRDRE BOLTON, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK HOST:  Good evening -- Mike.</p><p>Well, Facebook's $119 billion plus route -- one of the single, biggest  losses in stock market history for any one stock -- is definitely  Facebook's worst day ever by far.  So the stock plunged at 19 percent; it  closed near that level.  So the company missed quarterly revenue forecast,  it lowered its outlook and it said its revenue growth rate will slow.</p><p>Some investors are worried that while Facebook's user growth is stalling,  it's spending more.  The company committed to investing billions of dollars  per year on developing stronger privacy measures.  The company has faced  bruising headlines about its role in enabling fake news and election  meddling so some see these decisions as necessary.</p><p>Optimists say Facebook has more than two billion global users, it will  figure out its next best steps.  One contextual point, the company's  previous worst single day performance, you have to go back to July 2012.   The stock fell more than 11.5 percent at that time.  The company and  pivoted to selling mobile advertising and investors doubted that strategy.   Now it makes up 91 percent of the company's ad revenue.</p><p>But no matter what the future holds, today's drop sent founder and CEO Mark  Zuckerberg's personal net worth plummeting by more than $11 billion --  Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Ok.  So that's something we'll be watching Deirdre.</p><p>But from the negative to the positive -- what are the short term and long  term effects of this European trade deal?</p><p>BOLTON:  So President Trump -- his meeting with the E.C. president Jean- Claude Juncker put a pause in an escalating trade war, so that's a bright  spot.  Europe says it's going to buy more American soybeans and more  American liquid natural gas.</p><p>Soybeans are the U.S.'s biggest agri export and buying with more from  Europe is going to counter what China is not buying.  If Europe buys more  American liquid natural gas, it could be a win-win for both regions.   Analysts say the U.S. could become the world's biggest supplier of liquid  natural gas in the next five years which would equal U.S. job creation.</p><p>For Europe the win is decreasing its dependence on Russia.  Russia has a 35  percent market share as a gas supplier in Europe and Russia is  unpredictable.  It cut off pipelines in Eastern Europe in 2006, again in  2007 and '08 and again in 2014 with harsh winter conditions.  There were  casualties.  Some experts say Russia uses its natural gas supply as a  weapon.</p><p>The business question though for American liquid natural gas suppliers is  that they can sell at higher prices in Asia because Chinese manufacturing  is on fire.  So those company heads will have some big decisions ahead. </p><p>Mike -- back to you.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Deirdre Bolton from Fox Business -- thanks very much.</p><p>BOLTON:  Sure.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Republicans are going after Twitter tonight.  They say the social  media giant has purposely kept some of them from appearing in search  results.</p><p>Correspondent Peter Doocy reports on what some consider the latest example  of ideological censorship from the left.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PETER DOOCY, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  Congressman Matt Gaetz is one of the  Republicans whose Twitter handle was hidden for months from some curious  users searching for him.  Type his name and he didn't pop up.</p><p>Today the President whose Twitter account helped get him elected wrote,  \"Twitter shadow-banning prominent Republicans -- not good.  We will look  into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many complaints.\"</p><p>Another one of the allegedly blocked Republicans RNC chair Ronna McDaniel.  </p><p>KAYLEIGH MCENANY, RNC SPOKESWOMAN:  It took a tweet from the President of  the United States to get Twitter to care about every day Republican voters.   That's very troubling.</p><p>DOOCY:  The conservative shadow-ban appears to have been fixed this morning  for the first time since May when Twitter announced it would crackdown on  trolls contributing to an unhealthy dialogue and Twitter staffers explained  \"Some troll-like behavior is fun, good and humorous.  What we are talking  about today are troll-like behaviors that distort and detract from the  public conversation on Twitter particularly in communal areas like  conversations and search.\"</p><p>Those search bar changes aren't known to have impacted any Democrats.  The  spokesman for Donald Trump Jr. Andrew Sarabian claimed he was shadow- banned, too.  He tells Fox News, \"The targeted censorship of conservatives  on Twitter isn't some fringe conspiracy theory, it's actually happening.\"</p><p>Twitter insists \"Our behavioral ranking doesn't make judgments based on  political views or the substance of tweets.\"  Congressman Gaetz isn't so  sure.</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ (R), FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I have been notified to have been shadow-banned -- myself, Mark Meadows,  Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.</p><p>DOOCY:  In 2017, a Twitter employee deactivated President Trump's account  because he didn't like his policies but it was live again 11 minutes later.  </p><p>These new accusations of bias may be probed for months.</p><p>GAETZ:  This is no different than if a billboard company were to make a  donation to my opponents and not the same donation to me, that would be an  illegal corporate contribution and we're reviewing our options to complain  to the Federal Elections Commission about the way Twitter has treated us.   </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DOOCY:  So much talk about social media here in Washington has been about  how the Russians used it to meddle in the last election.  But the alleged  interference being discussed today didn't originate at the Kremlin, it came  from California -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Peter Doocy reporting on Capitol Hill.  Peter -- thanks.</p><p>Conservative Ohio Congressman Jim Jordan wants to be the next speaker of  the house next year.  Jordan made the announcement last night and sent his  letter to colleagues today.  Jordan is a former chairman of the House  Freedom Caucus.  He faces likely competition from Majority Leader Kevin  McCarthy and with Steve Scalise.  Current Speaker Paul Ryan is retiring at  the end of his term.</p><p>House Republicans are divided tonight over impeachment proceedings against  the number two official in the Justice Department.</p><p>Chief intelligence correspondent Catherine Herridge looks at both sides  tonight.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN (R-WI), SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE:  Do I support impeachment of  Rod Rosenstein?  No, I do not.  </p><p>CATHERINE HERRIDGE, FOX NEWS CHIEF INTELLIGENCE CORRESPONDENT:  The House  Speaker characterized the articles of impeachment filed by the House  Freedom Caucus as an extreme step.  </p><p>RYAN:  I don't think we should be cavalier with this process or with this  term.  I don't think that this rises to the level of high crimes and  misdemeanors.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  Among the allegations: the deputy attorney general Rod  Rosenstein has a conflict of interest overseeing the Russia probe because  he signed the final surveillance warrant for Trump campaign aide Carter  Page based in part on the unverified Trump dossier.</p><p>Months earlier, the former British spy behind the dossier, Christopher  Steele, was fired by the FBI for lying.  Steele also admitted his hatred  for candidate Trump.  </p><p>According to the articles of impeachment, quote, \"Deputy attorney general  Rosenstein's failure to recuse himself in light of this inherent conflict  of interest constitutes dereliction of duty.\"  </p><p>GAETZ:  It was very frustrating to hear the speaker call our efforts  cavalier.  Christopher Steele lied to the FBI.  Rod Rosenstein knew that  and was so cavalier that he thought that his information was still a basis  to spy on people associated with the Trump campaign.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  Democrats claim the goal is discrediting special counsel Robert  Mueller's Russia probe.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI (D-CA), HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  Just when you think  you've seen it all, Republicans have no shame to go to a place where they  would undermine our judicial system.  </p><p>REP. ADAM SCHIFF (D), CALIFORNIA:  If it's in the service of this  president, that's all they care about.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  A charge one key Republicans denies.  </p><p>REP. MARK MEADOWS (R), North Carolina:  I haven't discussed it with the  President and so I can tell you at this point who the President hires and  fires IS certainly not going to be influenced by something that this member  of congress does.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  In Boston the attorney general said house Republicans should  refocus and defended the department's number two.  </p><p>JEFF SESSIONS, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL:  My deputy, Rod Rosenstein, is highly  capable.  I have the highest confidence in him.  We need Congress to deal  with immigration questions.  </p><p>HERRIDGE:  The Justice Department failed to provide the withheld records.   A Republican aide said tonight they have a commitment from leadership to  hold a vote on a contempt resolution after the recess in early September,  insisting impeachment remains on the table -- Mike.</p><p>EMANUEL:  Catherine Herridge -- thanks very much.</p><p>HERRIDGE:  You're welcome.</p><p>EMANUEL:  The Associated Press is reporting documents from a London-based  investigative unit indicate the Moscow lawyer who met with Donald Trump Jr.  and is said to have promised the presidential campaign -- the Trump  presidential campaign -- dirt on Hillary Clinton, worked more closely with  Russian government officials than she previously let on.</p><p>The AP says the documents are from a company run by a Russian opposition  figure.  The documents reportedly paint a picture of Natalia Veselnitskaya  as a well-connected attorney who served as a ghost writer for top Russian  government lawyers and received assistance from senior interior ministry  personnel.  She has previously denied acting as representative of Russian  authorities.</p><p>Today is the deadline for the Trump administration to reunite children and  parents separated at the southern border during its zero-tolerance  enforcement.</p><p>Correspondent Casey Stegall tells us where things stand tonight from  Dallas.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>CASEY STEGALL, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  More than a thousand reunions have  taken place and hundreds more have been approved ahead of today's deadline  to have all children back with their families after being separated at the  border.  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE (through translator):  I was sad.  It was hard because I  wasn't together with my papa.  </p><p>STEGALL:  The federal judge who set the deadline saying it appears the U.S.  government was on track to meet it, even calling its efforts to reunite  more than 2,500 total kids a quote, \"remarkable achievement\" though ACLU  lawyers claim federal authorities manipulated numbers in the government's  favor.  </p><p>LEE GELERNT:  There are many other people that will ultimately need to be  reunified.  So when they say they are going to meet the deadlines it's only  for those individuals they declared to be eligible for reunification by the  deadline.  </p><p>STEGALL:  He is referring to the more than 900 children that the government  puts into the ineligible category.  According to court documents, more than  450 involve a parent who has already been deported.  </p><p>KIRSTJEN NIELSEN, U.S. HOMELAND SECURITY SECRETARY:  So these are parents  who have made the decision not to bring the children with them and then  will continue to work with the court to understand how we can best comply  with the order.  </p><p>STEGALL:  The ACLU and other immigration lawyers claim some of the people  left without their kids because they may have been misled by federal  officials.  </p><p>ROBERT LOPEZ, TEXAS CIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT:  It's going to be difficult for  parents who are in a different country and, you know, may not know how to  navigate the OR, the Office of Refugee Resettlement System.  </p><p>STEGALL:  U.S. district judge Dana Sombra did admonish the Department of  Justice for separating families without a plan in place, saying it quote,  \"lacked forethought with regard to keeping track of people\".</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>STEGALL:  Both sides will be back in court tomorrow updating the judge on  final numbers and to provide a status update on its continued efforts,  despite the deadline then being officially up -- Mike.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Casey Stegall, live in Dallas on this important immigration  issue.

Correspondent Gillian Turner tells us about a  new drug that might help slow the mental decline of Alzheimer's patients.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DR. KEITH FARGO, ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION:  Potentially this is a  breakthrough drug.  </p><p>GILLIAN TURNER, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT:  The long and discouraging medical  quest to find a treatment for Alzheimer's disease is looking promising  thanks to newly released results from a large-scale clinical trial.  Phase  two test results for a new drug known as a BAN2401 were rolled out at the  Alzheimer's Association international conference in Chicago yesterday, and  it's setting in the medical community abuzz with hope.  </p><p>FARGO:  There is a great feeling of progress happening in the field, and  everyone was very excited to hear the release of these results.  </p><p>TURNER:  Preliminary results show BAN2401 may have the ability to  successfully attack both changes to the brain brought about by the growth  of plaque and the symptoms it causes.  There is currently no effective  treatment for Alzheimer's aside from a couple of medications that slow down  memory decline for a period of months.  </p><p>But according to the Alzheimer's Association, the global urgency to better  treat and prevent Alzheimer's disease and other dementias is higher than  ever and growing.  This disease is devastating for Americans, 5.7 million  currently live with it, and by 2,050 this number will rise to 14 million.   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released a national plan  to address Alzheimer's disease that seeks to find a treatment by 2,025.   BAN2401 may be the most hopeful piece of that puzzle.  </p><p>FARGO:  If this pans out in larger studies, this is what we would call a  disease modifying drug, which is something the field does not yet have.  </p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>TURNER:  Experts also caution there's still a very long road ahead and  probably years before BAN2401 gets approved for patients used.  The  Japanese company that developed the drug just recently submitted an FDA  request to initiate that approval process.  Until then someone in America  is diagnosed with Alzheimer's every 65 seconds.  Mike?</p><p>EMANUEL:  Gillian Turner reporting.  Gillian, thanks very much.</p><p>As Republicans accuse Twitter of shadow banning, we'll look at social media  politics.  The panel joins me when we come back.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  When people search on Twitter for an account  that they might want to follow, typically those search results auto  complete or auto fill in.  But if people were searching for me or other  prominent conservatives in the Congress, our accounts weren't coming up.   That was not the same treatment given to Nancy Pelosi and Maxine Waters and  others on the left.  </p><p>SEN. JOHN KENNEDY, (R) LOUISIANA:  It sound like a coincidence, kind of  like when you disagree with President Putin you have a heart attack?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Senator Kennedy always has a good line.  Then there was quite the  moment on the Internet when you had President Trump go after Twitter come  on Twitter.  \"Twitter shadow banning prominent Republicans, not good.  We  will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once.  Many  complaints.\"  </p><p>Can Twitter live to fight another day?  Let's bring in our panel, Byron  York, chief political correspondent for the \"Washington Examiner.\" Mollie  Hemingway, senior editor at \"The Federalist,\" and Mo Elleithee, executive  director of the Georgetown Institute of Politics.  OK, Byron, what do you  make of was there some shadow banning going on on Twitter?  </p><p>BRYON YORK, CHIEF POLITICAL CORRESPONDENT, \"WASHINGTON EXAMINER\":  It  appears there was.  I don't think there's any doubt that these big tech  companies do lean left.  There was a report in \"Vice\" that I think made a  pretty good case that there was shadow banning going on against Ronna  McDaniel, Devin Nunes, Matt Gaetz you just saw, and others.  This was part  of Twitter's plan to encourage a healthy conversation.  The problem is  Twitter gets to decide what is healthy.  So I don't think it's really a  surprise.  It's kind of a continuation of what we see, infringement of  speech on college campuses.  People leave college campuses, they go work  for Twitter, and this is continued.  So I think it was probably a good idea  for the president to point this out and give it prominence.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>MOLLIE HEMINGWAY, SENIOR EDITOR, \"THE FEDERALIST\":  He was wrong when he  said it was illegal.  I don't know if we have any actual law that can be  cited that's actually illegal, but it's definitely a problem.  Twitter and  other social media companies that are restricting speech.  If you care  about the culture of speech, you want to make sure you have this free flow  of ideas. </p><p>And I think conservatives have been complaining about this, not just the  issue that was mentioned in the report of when you search for a name you  can't find it, but actual downplaying of conservatives and hiding what  conservatives are tweeting.  You are seeing this across different social  media platforms.  It's partly because they built algorithms that have the  bias built into it.  They privilege certain types of communication and  punish other types of communication.  It's a very frustrating experience.   You see a lot of people who want to control the discourse in regular media  and social media, and it actually leads to a lot of frustration among the  average population.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Here's more from Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz about this very  issue.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. MATT GAETZ, (R) FLORIDA:  There are only four members of Congress that  I've been notified have been shadow banned, myself, Mark Meadows, Jim  Jordan, and Devin Nunes.  And the thing that we obviously all have in  common is that we are four of the strongest supporters of President Trump  and we have been very critical of the Russia investigation.  So I don't  know if that's the reason why we were supposedly inadvertently caught in  Twitters troll trap, but it seems very suspicious to me.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>MO ELLEITHEE, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, GEORGETOWN INSTITUTE OF POLITICS:  First  I have to say as someone who works on a college campus that invites people  from both sides of the aisle, I couldn't let your comment about college  campuses go by without at least a subtle pushback.  </p><p>YORK:  I'll exclude yours.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I appreciate that.  </p><p>When Twitter announced back in May how they were going to go after  trolling, my initial thought when I read it is, OK, this is good.  Pushing  for more civil discourse on social media is a good thing.  Trying to push  back on those who are trying to disrupt conversation is a good thing.  But  I remember also thinking, they are going to get stuck here.  They're going  to catch the wrong people.  </p><p>And it seems that this is what is happening here.  The fact that Ronna  Romney McDaniel had this problem, but someone like an Alex Jones at Info  Wars didn't, that seems to be counterintuitive to what they are trying to  do.  Here's the problem.  These social media companies are trying to be  good citizens and encourage good debate and good conversation.  They are  trying to prevent themselves from being manipulated or being used as  organizing tools by hate groups or by foreign governments.  But at the same  time, they want to be platforms for free speech.  They are seeing it as a  challenge to do all of those things.  I applaud the effort for civil  discourse, but they have shown that they still have some work to do to  figure out how to do it right.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  OK, next issue, election security.  We expect a meeting tomorrow  at the White House.  Take a listen to this exchange.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. PAUL RYAN, (R) SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:  We have got  to make sure that we have the right kind of information sharing with  states, with secretaries of states, and with anybody else that could see a  cyber from Russia.  </p><p>REP. NANCY PELOSI, (D) HOUSE MINORITY LEADER:  House Republicans refuse to  act for any oversight, any founding, because they are now more concerned  about covering up President Trump's activities than defending our democracy  from foreign attack.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  So here we are three plus months away from the next election.   How alarmed should we be, Mo?  </p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I think we should be alarmed.  I think every independent  analyst that has looked at our elections systems from a nonpartisan  perspective keeps pointing to holes in the systems and areas where we are  vulnerable.  And I would love to see our federal government in a bipartisan  way step forward.  I don't think any administration has done what it needed  to do in recent times.  Step forward and figure out how to plug those  holes.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  The strength of our system is actually how decentralized it is,  though.  This is very much a local and state issue.  If people care about  it they should tackle it at the local level.  The more you centralize  election systems the more vulnerable they are and the more valuable those  hacks become.</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  You can give more support to the states, though, to do it.</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  And we have known about this for a long time.  We're having  warnings right now, but we've had warnings for four years or more about  China trying to do the same thing.  So we should be on guard against many  foreign entities.  </p><p>YORK:  This White House meeting, if only for the optics and P.R. of this,  they should have had this a long time ago.  The midterms are less than 100  days away, and we've had so many accusations that the Trump administration  has done nothing to try to stop Russian and other foreign meddling in these  upcoming elections when in fact some of these intelligence agencies  apparently have been working on this but they won't talk about it.  So some  sort of public sign that the president and the government are actually  doing something is really overdue.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Something I would like to get to quickly is the race for House  speaker for the next Congress is heating up.  Here we are about 100 days  out.  What do you make of it, Byron?  </p><p>YORK:  I think you are seeing with the entry of Jim Jordan in the race, I  think you're seeing the same dynamics that have driven Republicans in the  House crazy, the same dynamic that drove John Boehner crazy, and the same  dynamic that has drove Paul Ryan crazy is now showing up again, which is a  group of 40 or 50 really conservative Republicans disagreeing with the rest  of the party on a lot of key issues.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I think it's just a healthy thing when you have races that are  contested and it helps you understand more about the caucus.  Kevin  McCarthy is the clear frontrunner.  You have a Freedom Caucus candidate who  has thrown his hat in the right, and you might see someone from the left  also enter the ring.  In general, I think these are healthy things.  You  get to learn more about what issues the Republican caucus cares about, and  that will help whoever is the eventual leader know how to manage the  caucus.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mo, your thoughts?</p><p>ELLEITHEE:  I think a lot of Democrats are excited to see this race between  McCarthy and Jordan play out.  A lot of it is going to depend on what  happens in November and whether this is a race for speaker or a race for  minority leader.  And if Democrats win back the House I will be curious to  see at what expense.  When Republicans won back the house it was at the  expense of a lot of moderate Democrats.  The caucus got then moved to the  left.  If Democrats win back the House, is it by defeating a lot of freedom  caucus type of candidates or more moderate candidates, and that will define  this race.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  All right, we have to leave it there.  Next up, the president  takes a victory lap after his trade deal.</p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  I have to say because we  have a lot of farmers in this place, we had this hat made up.  Look at  that, it's John Deere colors actually, but make our farmer great again.   Isn't that great?</p><p>These are incredible people, and you know we have given them a little help  yesterday.  We are giving them help.  And everybody is going to be back  because we have the greatest farms in the world.  </p><p>STEVE MNUCHIN, TREASURY SECRETARY:  This is not a bailout.  This is a  reciprocal role -- again, we want free and fair reciprocal trade, and  that's what we're fighting for.  </p><p>To the extent people use political issues to target our farmers, the  president will stand up for them. </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Some of the latest talk on trade, and tomorrow we've expecting  GDP numbers.  And the president gave us a heck of a tease.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  It will only get better.   Our numbers are fantastic right now.  You're going to see on Friday what  happens with GPD.  A lot of predictions, a lot of predictions.  I told you  before, some with a five in front of it.  There were predictions frm 3.8 to  5.3.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  It's 3.8 to 5.3, and we are back with our panel, Byron, Mollie,  and Mo.  Where are we, Byron, on the economy, on these tariffs?  </p><p>YORK:  I think the biggest economic news of the week could be coming  tomorrow.  Larry Kudlow came out and all but predicted economic growth for  the second quarter at four percent or higher.  And if you get four percent  economic growth, if you think the president has bragged about the economy  before, you just wait until there's actual four percent growth in the  economy.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Mollie, your thoughts?</p><p>HEMINGWAY:  I also think the news we got yesterday about the E.U. moving  towards low tariffs or no tariffs with the U.S. is significant news.  We've  had so much criticism of the Trump administration's tariff policy.  People  say high tariffs are a really bad thing.  The Trump administration, not  just President Trump, but you saw this in last night's interview with  Wilbur Ross said the strategy is to get to low tariffs.  We've had this  post-World War II order that saw the ratcheting up of tariffs.  Partly that  was our desire to help a bunch of more ravaged countries after World War II  build up their economy.  They don't quite need that now.  Some of them are  powerhouses themselves.  So if you want to renegotiate this, you can't just  ask for it.  You actually have to threaten it.  That's the Trump  administration approach here, and their strategy might be paying off.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  Here is the president talking about what he has worked out with  the E.U.  Take a listen to this.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  We opened up Europe, and  that's going to be a great thing for Europe and it's really going to be a  great thing for us.  And it's going to be a really great thing for our  farmers because you have just got yourself one big market that really  essentially -- wouldn't you say it never existed, because you just had a  problem.  So we did that yesterday afternoon.  We signed a letter of  intent, or agreed to a letter of intent, and we are starting the documents,  but the relationship is very, very good.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  All right, Mo, so where are we on trade and tariffs?  </p><p>ELLEITHEE:  First of all, if I'm correct, the United States was already the  greatest exporter of soybeans to Europe, so saying that market wasn't there  before is a little off.  I will be curious to see what happens here.  It  feels like we have been here before where it wasn't that long ago that the  administration announced a major breakthrough with China when it came to  trade negotiations, and it was going to be great for us, and then it fell  apart.  </p><p>And what we've got is a commitment for a conversation.  I'm always for  conversation, I'm always for negotiation.  We'll see how that plays.  But  we haven't seen any details yet, we haven't seen any super strong  commitment yet.  And on a lot of goods, like steel and like aluminum, those  tariffs are still in place, and we see -- I know the package talked about  one anecdote with one company that was bringing back jobs, but there are  lots of anecdotes about companies that are still losing jobs as a result of  these tariffs and costs going up.  So I think we should encourage the  negotiations, but we are not there yet.  </p><p>HEMINGWAY:  One of the tweets that President Trump had earlier this week  that I thought was interesting is when he complained that people were  snipping at his heels and that it was difficult to negotiate when you have  all this criticism.  I took that to mean that he was trying to tell people  if you want to get to lower tariffs, you have to play the game here.  And  to have all this opposition and not figure out what the U.S. is trying to  do in taking on some huge structural problems with China but also with  other countries where you have regulatory barriers that prevent American  companies from selling their products in different places, or intellectual  property theft or really high tariffs.  </p><p>If you think the status quo is fine, you are opposed to the Trump  administration doing anything.  If you don't think the status quo is fine,  you should be thinking about how to help get to this eventual goal of the  Trump administration of lower tariffs.  They keep saying it.  Trump said it  in Canada, he'd like to move to no tariffs, no barriers.  If you are a free  marketer, if you like that, you should probably figure out what's going on  here.  </p><p>YORK:  The big news yesterday was not that they reach the agreement to get  there.  It was that they reached an agreement to stop going in the wrong  direction, which I think, just stop the threatening and the fighting is  probably a good idea.  Some of the tariffs are in place already and have  not been taken up.  But so much of this hysteria about this has been over  tariffs that were planned or threatened but are not in effect.  So if you  can just kind of stopped that and move, as Mollie said, toward a lower  tariff world, maybe Trump has had a good idea.  </p><p>EMANUEL:  I can tell you that a bunch of Republican heads nearly blew up  when there was talk about a $12 billion bailout to American farmers, so  we'll see where it goes from here.  </p><p>When we come back, an incredible success story about socks.   </p><p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p><p>EMANUEL:  Finally tonight, a really feel-good story.  A lot of hard work  has paid off for a 22-year-old fine young man with Down syndrome.  The  socket company he founded alongside his dad is now worth $4 million.  After  just a year and a half, John's Crazy Socks has created 35 jobs and raise  around $135,000 for its charity partners.  John designs the socks himself  and fills the orders.  </p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  John had worn crazy socks his whole life, that was his  thing.  </p><p>What's our mission?  </p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE:  Our mission is to spread happiness.  </p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMANUEL:  And John filled some pretty important borders.  Former president  George Herbert Walker Bush is a fan.  John has been exchanging socks with  Mr. Bush for the past year or so.  And I've got to tell you, I love the  story so much, I went on the website and I ordered some socks for myself  today.  I love a good pair of crazy sock, and you can see some of the  former president's fun socks there, Superman, and some other fun stuff.  </p><p>That's it for this edition of SPECIAL REPORT.  I'm Mike Emanuel in  Washington.  \"The Story\" with guest host Sandra Smith starts right now.</p><p>END</p><p>[Copy: Content and Programming Copyright 2018 Fox News Network, LLC.

In his opening speech at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2019, HKMA Chief Executive Mr Eddie Yue noted fintech development in Hong Kong has gathered remarkable momentum ever since the first FinTech Week three years ago.</p><p><br/><br/>The HKMA also took the chance to highlight a series of initiatives aimed to foster the fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>Blockchain collaboration with the subsidiary of Institute of Digital Currency of People's Bank of China (PBoC)<br/><br/>Today a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC to conduct a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial, which aims to connect eTradeConnect1 and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The PoC is expected to begin in Q1 2020. Once the connection has successfully been established, it will provide firms in both places with more convenient trade finance services and enable banks in Hong Kong to expedite the expansion of their trade finance business.<br/><br/>Joint research with Bank of Thailand - Project LionRock-Inthanon<br/><br/>As a follow-up to the MoU signed between the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand in May 2019, the two authorities are conducting a joint research project named Project LionRock-Inthanon to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (PvP) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand. A joint report is scheduled to be released in Q1 2020.<br/><br/>Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre<br/><br/>The first ever Innovation Hub of BIS commenced its operation in Hong Kong in November 2019, a testimony that Hong Kong stands at the forefront of fintech innovation. The HKMA believes that the Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre will serve as a focal point for regional fintech collaboration and bring the application of innovative technologies among central banks to a new level. Initially, the HKMA will explore with the Hong Kong Centre on the use of Distributed Ledger Technology to digitalise trade finance processes and study the impact of big tech to financial markets.<br/><br/>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Banking<br/><br/>The HKMA is conducting a study on the application of AI technology in the banking industry and will release a series of publications. To begin with, the HKMA published today a fact sheet to highlight the key facts and figures revealed in an industry-wide survey conducted in Q3 2019. One of the key findings shows almost 90% of the surveyed retail banks have adopted or plan to adopt AI applications. The survey included interviews and questionnaires conducted with banks, industry organisations, and fintech firms, with a view to understanding the current AI landscape in the banking industry. In the coming months, a series of reports will be published.<br/><br/>Fin+Tech Collaboration Platform to accelerate innovation and collaboration<br/><br/>The HKMA jointly launched the Fin+Tech Collaboration Platform today with the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks to support fintech development in a technology-centric approach. Industry players can make use of the platform to organise fintech-related activities such as accelerators and hackathons to explore innovative solutions, identify talents, and seek collaboration opportunities. The HKMA will also make use of the platform's hardware and software facilities for some of its fintech projects (including Project LionRock-Inthanon).<br/><br/>Mr Eddie Yue said, 'The HKMA's fintech initiatives have successfully created a vibrant fintech ecosystem. To lift Hong Kong's fintech development to a new height, we must take a holistic 'HK Inc.' approach. I look forward to partnering with our stakeholders including financial institutions, end users, start-up firms, technology service providers, investors and regulators to walk towards the shared purposes of driving innovation, enhancing customer experience and facilitating financial inclusion.

Maxine Waters, the California Democrat who heads the House Financial Services Committee, announced Wednesday that Zuckerberg will testify at a hearing by the panel on Oct. 23. The focus will be on Facebook's plan to create a digital currency and its role in housing. The company agreed in a legal settlement in March to overhaul its ad-targeting systems to prevent discrimination in housing, credit and employment ads.</p><p>Lawmakers from both parties and top regulators, including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, have criticized Facebook's plan for the new currency, expressing concern that it could be used for illicit activity such as money laundering or drug trafficking. There also is concern that the massive reserve created with money used to buy the new currency, to be called Libra, could supplant the Fed and destabilize the financial system, and that consumers could be hurt by Libra losses.</p><p>\"Mark looks forward to testifying before the House Financial Services Committee and responding to lawmakers' questions,\" Facebook said in a statement Wednesday.</p><p>In July, Waters and other committee Democrats sent a letter to Facebook requesting a halt on moving forward with the currency and with the digital wallet, called Calibra, which would be used in the new currency system. House Democrats also have threatened legislation that would block big tech companies from getting into banking.</p><p>Waters has called Libra \"a new Swiss-based financial system\" that potentially is too big to fail and could require a taxpayer bailout.</p><p>France's finance minister said Wednesday that the European Union should not allow Facebook to develop the currency project on \"European territory\" because it threatens the monetary sovereignty of member countries. \"It should not be the role of a private company to try to get a sovereign currency like a sovereign state,\" Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said.</p><p>Unlike digital currencies such as bitcoin or Ethereum, Facebook's plan calls for Libra to be backed by real currencies.</p><p>David Marcus, the Facebook executive leading the project, told lawmakers over two days of congressional hearings in July that Facebook would not launch the currency project until it had received all the necessary approvals from regulators and secured safeguards to protect the privacy of users' data. He said Facebook will not control Libra because Facebook will be only one of about 100 companies and nonprofits in an association that will manage the currency.</p><p>The plan would open low-cost online commerce to millions of people around the world who lack access to bank accounts, and would make it cheaper to send money across borders, Marcus said.

Good Wednesday morning everybody. Thanks so much for joining us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday July 29th.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Your top stories right now, 8:00 on the button on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a big day in Washington. We've got it all covered.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Big tech on the Hill. The CEOs of Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple will all appear for an anti-trust hearing later today. What is at stake for these industry giants and how will you be impacted.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Plus the battle over stimulus goes on. We are looking at the differences between the Republican and the Democratic plans today and how it impacts your wallet coming up.</p><p>It is also Fed Day. Investors listening closely to what Federal Reserve chairman Jay Powell will have to say about the economic impact of the coronavirus after the central bank announced it is extending its emergency lending program. Powell will speak at 2:15 p.m. Eastern and we'll have it live.</p><p>A fiery hearing on Capitol Hill meanwhile yesterday between AG William Barr and the Democrats. The hearing appeared to have more questions than answers, at least that were allowed. But as he was grilled the Attorney General had a question of his own. How long will we let our cities burn?</p><p>Meanwhile, federal agents pulling out of Seattle. Other cities could follow suit despite ongoing violence.</p><p>And it is another big day for earnings. Dow component Boeing reported this morning. The company says it has close to 10 billion in untapped credit and has cut production on its 787, and the 777 programs. The stock this morning is lower.</p><p>General Electric hit by an aircraft industry -- the aircraft industry taking a $2 billion loss as its jet engine business tumbles. It is saying to expect a return to positive cash flow in 2021.</p><p>And General Motors rising premarket after a beat on earnings. The automaker saying it's ramping up U.S. production as it works to increase dealer stock.</p><p>As you can see all three stocks are actually trading higher this morning. Boeing back in positive territory, up three-quarters of one point.</p><p>Turning to markets this morning, broadly speaking, futures are lower. This after -- futures are higher this morning after losses yesterday. Take a look at where we stand this morning. Dow futures up 22. The Nasdaq futures up 55 and the S&amp;P futures up 6 points.</p><p>After yesterday's declines at the end of the day, the Dow Industrials were down in the triple digits at 4:00 on Wall Street. Dow Industrials giving up 205 points yesterday.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA is live right now.</p><p>Global markets this morning are mixed take a look. FT 100 is up 9 points. The CAC 40 is up 39. And the Dax index in Germany just turning positive. It is up 6 points right now on the Dax.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets finished mostly higher China was the best performer.

She says the hospital system could face collapse. The Hang Seng was up half a percent. The Shanghai composite meanwhile, up better than 2 percent.</p><p>Gold prices still shining today, working their way towards $2,000 for an ounce. $1,971 last trade on gold, up about a third of a percent.</p><p>Joining the conversation this morning: Dagen McDowell, Philip Wegmann and Scott Martin. Great to see everybody this morning.</p><p>DAGEN MCDOWELL, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Great to see you.</p><p>PHILIP WEGMANN, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Hi, guys.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Some of the top stories that we are watching this morning.</p><p>Big tech on the hot seat today on Capitol Hill. The CEOs from Amazon, Apple. Facebook and Google will testify by video before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee. They're expected to be grilled over their growing influence and the impact on competition. The testimony could help build public pressure for government action to remove the protections that these companies enjoy.</p><p>In separate statements Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, and Sundar Pichai all emphasized competition that their companies already face as well as their contributions to the U.S. economy.</p><p>Taking a look at big tech this morning, all the stocks are up this morning. Best performer right now is Amazon, up better than 1 percent.</p><p>Sparks flying on Capitol Hill yesterday as Democrats spar with Attorney General Bill Barr during a heated House hearing Democrats grilling Barr yesterday on his handling of the unrest in Portland and the Russia probe. Barr firing back accusing Democrats of turning a blind mind eye to ongoing violence across the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: Federal courts are under attack. since when is it ok to try to burn down a federal court? If someone went down the street to the (INAUDIBLE) court here, that beautiful courthouse we have right at the bottom of the Hill and started breaking windows and firing industrial grade fireworks in to start a fire, throw kerosene balloons in and start fires in the court, is that ok? Is that ok now?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Also Barr dealing with Democrat accusations that he is carrying out President Trump's political wishes as well. It was all politics yesterday in the House Judiciary Committee.</p><p>Meanwhile grim new milestones in the COVID-19 pandemic. Six states reporting one day records for deaths as Texas becomes the fourth state to pass the 400,000 COVID case mark. Dr. Anthony Fauci is now warning parts of the Midwest. There are early signs that a coronavirus outbreak could be brewing in Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee and Kentucky.</p><p>Stimulus battle rages meanwhile. Lawmakers are negotiating a new round of coronavirus aid. One point of contention on both sides of the aisle, funding for non-COVID-19 related items including a new FBI building. President Trump weighed in yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: We'll be negotiating -- it's sort of semi-irrelevant because the Democrats come with their needs and asks and the Republicans go with theirs. So we'll be discussing it with Mitch and all of the other people involved.</p><p>We want to do what is best for the people. I want to do what is best for the people. I want to do what is best for the economy because that means jobs and lots of good things.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now is Delaware Senator Chris Coons.</p><p>And Senator, it's great to see you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>SEN. CHRIS COONS (D-DE): Great to see you, Maria. Thanks for having me on.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So tell me what the priority is from your standpoint. What needs to be in this stimulus package?</p><p>COONS: Well, Maria, what's striking is that the House of Representatives passed the HEROES Act two months ago. And the biggest pieces of that bill that are utterly lacking in the HEALS Act, which was just introduced by Majority Leader McConnell here in the Senate, is aid to state and local governments.</p><p>As you may know, I spend 10 years in county government in Delaware. All over our country we've got state and local governments that have record revenue shortfalls. A million and a half public employees have already been laid off. And these aren't faceless folks in gray buildings. They're teachers, they're paramedics, they're nurses. They're the folks who administer programs like unemployment or small business assistance at the local level.</p><p>And so frankly, I think we have to provide another round of relief to state and local governments.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, how are you going to ensure that those state and local governments use the money wisely? We know that the state unemployment coffers are under serious strain.</p><p>You know, we had Mayor de Blasio on the show a couple -- about a month ago. He says he needs $7.5 billion right now. What is he going to use the money for? It's not -- it's obviously not going to help the police bring law and order in any of these cities.</p><p>COONS: Well, Maria frankly, having adequate funding for state and local police is an important part of continuing to have a prosperous and stable and safe and secure local communities.</p><p>But frankly, so is having the resources for reopening our schools safely. One of the key things that I think was missing from the HEALS Act was sufficient funding for schools to reopen, both to have enough for testing and enough for PPE.</p><p>I'm hearing lots of concerns in Delaware from small businesses about another round of PPP support that will help them either get open again or stay open, from parents and teachers about safe reopening of schools, and from citizens who are concerned about whether or not the unemployment benefits that they've benefited from over the last two months -- four months now -- will still be there.</p><p>We are about to hit a significant cliff where an eviction moratorium for renters, which is about a third of all Delawareans, and the unemployment benefit from the CARES Act from four months ago will both run out. We've had two months to negotiate.</p><p>I'm really disappointed frankly that we are just now seeing Majority Leader McConnell's proposal. And it's a proposal that clearly doesn't have the support of all of the Republican caucus. I'm talking to Republican colleagues, about half of that caucus isn't going to support that bill.</p><p>So these negotiations need to get going and get going quickly in a way that will help us again deliver bipartisan support to the American people.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, you're right. People are facing some serious strain out there.</p><p>But let's go through some of the thing you said.</p><p>First off, on schools. The president had earmarked $105 billion. Is that not the right number?</p><p>And secondly on the CARES Act that was passed in the House a couple of months ago, it is totaling $3.5 trillion that Nancy Pelosi would like to move forward. It includes $600 unemployment benefits until January.</p><p>We are talking about debt in this country of $21 trillion. We are soon going to be having as much debt as the entire size of the economy at $22 trillion. So was that a realistic plan?</p><p>I know you say, well, we passed it months ago, I'm disappointed hearing what the GOP is coming up with now, but was $3.5 trillion truly realistic given its price tag?</p><p>COONS: Well Maria let's be clear. Four months ago the Senate passed the CARES Act unanimously. That was $2.3 trillion. Two months ago the House did pass what's called the HEROES Act, and it's got a price tag a little over $3 trillion.</p><p>What's been introduced here in the Senate just yesterday is at about a trillion. That is a big difference, $1 trillion to $3 trillion.</p><p>Of course, we have to be concerned about the long-term impact of our national debt. We are pushing out more spending to sustain our economy, to respond to this pandemic than has been done federally since the Second World War.</p><p>But what I hear from small business owners, from parents, from public employees, from folks who've lost their jobs is that, if it were not for this federal support, we would be in the second great depression.</p><p>So there are 30 million Americans roughly who are relying on this $600 a week additional federal unemployment. The proposal that we've just seen from the Republican majority here in the Senate would make every person take a 30 percent pay cut who is currently relying on unemployment.</p><p>One of the main challenges we face is antiquated I.T. systems at the state and federal level, changing that so that we've got a more resilient, more adjustable system isn't going to be possible on the fly in a couple weeks.</p><p>So, we've got to negotiate something that is responsible in this environment. And in my view, that means extending unemployment for an awful lot of folks who otherwise won't be able to keep a roof over the heads of their families.</p><p>There's one other thing I wanted to talk about Maria, if I could for a moment --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Of course.</p><p>COONS: Today I'm introducing a bipartisan bill with Senator Rubio, Senator Cornyn, Senator Hassan. It's a manufacturing resiliency task force.</p><p>One of the things we've seen in this pandemic is that we are vitally reliant on China for critical supplies, whether it's medical devices like ventilators or it's pharmaceuticals.</p><p>And this is a look at how we could restore to the United States manufacturing that has gone offshore in the last 20 years and that we should try and bring back to the United States, so that we're not as vulnerable to sudden shocks globally, whether it's a pandemic or something else.</p><p>I think this is an important next step in making sure that manufacturing in the United States is resilient and can get built back stronger after this recession.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, it is. And you are right.</p><p>And thank you for introducing this legislation, because I think many Americans were just, you know, shocked to learn that 70 percent of our active ingredients in our prescription drugs are made in China.</p><p>And in the middle of the pandemic China tried to threaten us, with \"The Global Times\" state-run media saying, well, maybe we won't export these prescription drugs right now since Trump is pushing Xi Jinping on tariffs. So this is very important.</p><p>Let me ask you this, Senator. How long do you expect it is going to take for an average company to say, OK, I am taking my -- my supply chain out of China, and I'm going to put in the U.S. or I'm going to put it in India, et cetera?</p><p>Is this an eight-year -- an eight-year timeframe, five-year timeframe? Because I know this doesn't happen overnight. It's great to get this started, but this is a long term decision.</p><p>COONS: It is. Maria, I worked for a global manufacturing company for eight years before I went into local government. And I will tell you, reallocating manufacturing resources facilities around the world is a challenging thing to do.</p><p>It depends on what industrial sector you are in. And whether you are leasing contract manufacturing space or whether you directly own and have built and control it.</p><p>China has been the most appealing, fastest growing market for decades, and many American companies have been heavily invested there.</p><p>But this is not a new development. Over the last five years Xi Jinping has taken the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party in a sharply different direction. So many American companies have already been looking at the question of whether they couldn't diversity where they're doing manufacturing.</p><p>What I'm hoping we'll do is to provide incentives for them to bring that manufacturing back to the United States. The company I worked for had much of its manufacturing in Germany and the United States, because it was advanced manufacturing so it required high-skilled, highly-integrated workforces.</p><p>I think we can compete and win in manufacturing. It just requires sustained bipartisan focus on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. It does. And we are going to need that manufacturing base fired up in the U.S. because the services part of our economy right now is shot, obviously, in a shutdown.</p><p>Senator, we'll be watching the developments. We so appreciate your time and energy on this. Thank you, sir.</p><p>COONS: Thank you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Senator Chris Coons.</p><p>Coming up, Trump 2020 campaign press secretary Hogan Gidley is here talking about the latest on the race for the White House. Much more ahead.</p><p>You're watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA live on Fox Business.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Tech giants on the Hill. The CEOs from Facebook, Amazon, Apple and Google will testify before Congress today.</p><p>Hillary Vaughn is in Washington right now with a preview. Hillary.</p><p>HILLARY VAUGHN, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CORRESPONDENT: Good morning, Maria.</p><p>This is the first time all four tech CEOs will appear virtually before Congress. Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Apple's Tim Cook, Alphabet Google's Sundar Pichai will have the same goal today. Convince Congress they are not too big and they should not be broken up or reined in by regulators.</p><p>All four companies are in the top six most valuable public companies in the world and their top executives showing up today even virtually shows how important this is on their agenda.</p><p>We got to look at their opening statements and here is the takeaway from each CEO that we will hear today.</p><p>Amazon's Jeff Bezos is the only one who has not testified before Congress yet. His case for competition is this. Brick-and-mortar stores like Target, Costco and Walmart have both a larger physical presence in U.S. but also a rapidly growing online presence. He will also talk about how the pandemic has forced large companies to become even more competitive online saying this, quote, \"Curbside pickup of online orders has increased over 200 percent in part due to COVID-19 concerns. We also face new competition from the likes of Shopify and Instacart.</p><p>Apple's Tim Cook will make the case that one of their biggest rivals is sitting on the virtual witness bench right next to him, Google saying Apple competes with their Android devices along with LG and Huawei saying this. \"I share the subcommittee's belief that competition is a great virtue. That it promotes innovation, that it makes space for the next great idea and that it gives consumers more choices.</p><p>Google's Sundar Pichai has testified in front of Congress before and has come under scrutiny on a flood of issues from things like privacy and politics. Today he will make the case that the phrase \"Google it\" is now competing with things like \"Hey Siri\" and \"Hey Alexa\" saying there's more ways for consumers to look things up than ever before.</p><p>He'll also talk about the free services that they offer like Maps and Gmail and how those are key to making Main Street stay online during the pandemic saying quote, \"I am deeply proud that because of our tools, businesses on Main Street can compete in a away that was not possible 20 years ago. Nearly a third of small business owners say without digital tools they would have had to close all or part of their business.\"</p><p>And finally Facebook Mark Zuckerberg warns that regulator should not make changes that threaten freedom of innovation that make it look more like a China. Facebook has been bombarded with criticism over political bias on their platform. Has made both Republicans and Democrats unhappy with them. He will say that ultimately he thinks that decision should not be up to them, but instead there should be a one rule for all from regulators, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. Hillary, we'll be watching. It should be interesting.</p><p>Be sure to tune in later today on Fox Business. We'll be taking that tech hearing live starting at noon Eastern. You can watch the full hearing right here live.</p><p>Plus the changing movie business. The new deal to shorten the time between a theatre release and the digital copies. We're going to take a look at that when we come right back.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Blockbusters headed to your home sooner. AMC and Universal Pictures have agreed to cut the exclusive theatrical window to 17 days. A source telling \"The Wall Street Journal\" that AMC also negotiated a share of the revenue new Universal movies will earn from digital rentals purchased on other platforms such as Apple TV and Amazon's Web site.</p><p>Dagen, you'll those movies sooner rather than later. What do you think?</p><p>MCDOWELL: It was -- these companies have been pushed into this by the pandemic. And you will not going to have crowded theatres, people flocking back to movie theatres until there's a vaccine in this country. Maybe that's later this year, maybe it's next year but this has to happen.</p><p>Again with really big movies like (INAUDIBLE) people will flock to the theatres trying to see that with the super sound and the giant screen. But I'm perfectly happy to watch the King of Staten Island, that Pete Davidson movie sitting in my pajamas.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Me, too. I love it Scottie Martin. What do you think? I mean, you know, we all have these big TVs now and it's more comfortable at home.</p><p>SCOTT MARTIN, KINGSVIEW ASSET MANAGEMENT: Yes. I would add (INAUDIBLE) to that list too, Maria, and I put on a tank top myself not the PJs.</p><p>And I'll tell you what. Insert that pun here, Maria, but if the theaters and the production companies didn't do something about the streaming in the pandemic we know how this movie ends. They're going to go out of business and so therefore, I think they're making the right move in shortening the release.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Philip, you've got to adapt. We're in an incredible moment in time.</p><p>WEGMANN: You've got to adapt and I think what is interesting is that the past time of going to the movies with their friends, I think that -- that might be disappearing not just because of the pandemic but because it's easier to stay at home and, you know, we're going to be watching a lot more television alone by ourselves, I think moving forward. And I think that's kind of sad actually.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Unbelievable. It's just extraordinary how many things have changed since this pandemic arrived, just four months ago.</p><p>All right. We will keep looking at it.</p><p>We'll take a break.</p><p>When we come back, Trump 2020 campaign press secretary Hogan Gidley is here talking about the latest on the race for the White House.</p><p>A lot more ahead. You are watching MORNINGS WITH MARIA, live on fox business.</p><p>We'll be right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Wednesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo. And it is Wednesday, July 29th. A look at markets right here just before 8:30 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>We got gain pretty much across the board now. Dow Industrials now at the highs of the morning. Dow futures up 57 points, Nasdaq futures up 67. Tech is on fire again this morning. And the S&amp;P 500 up 10 points this morning.</p><p>It is a big day in Washington. Big tech CEOs are testifying. We've got stimulus negotiations ongoing and the decision from the Federal Reserve.</p><p>All ahead of that, futures are rallying right now.</p><p>Let's check global markets this morning. A firmer tone there as well. European indices this morning up across the board now with the FT 100 up 20 points, the CAC quarante up 40 points and the DAX index in Germany up 7 points.</p><p>In Asia overnight markets were mostly higher. The best performer was China. The Shanghai composite overnight up better than 2 percent. Japan was down. The Nikkei average down better than 1 percent.</p><p>Well, we are learning more this morning about the woman killed in a rare shark attack in Maine.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with those details.</p><p>Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FBN CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Maria.</p><p>It's a sad story. Julie Dimperio Holowach was a form New York City fashion executive. The 63-year-old was swimming near Bailey Island with her daughter just 20 yards offshore, close to the family's vacation home. Officials confirm she was attacked by a great white shark. Kayakers who witnessed the attack rushed her to shore but couldn't save her. Her daughter, luckily, was not hurt. This is the first deadly shark attack in Maine's history.</p><p>Well, seeking office. A record 122 black or multiracial black women have filed to run for Congress in the upcoming election. According to the Center for American Women in Politics, that figure has steadily increased. In 2012, the number was just 48. The collective pac (ph) says nearly 60 black women are still in the running for November.</p><p>And, finally, here is a look at what is trending this morning on foxbusiness.com.</p><p>Dr. Anthony Fauci warns the Major League Baseball season may be in jeopardy after four more Marlins players tested positive for Covid-19.</p><p>Spirit Airliners is going to inform its unions this week that up to 30 percent of its worker may be furloughed come October.</p><p>And a mystery buyer just snagged a record setting $102 million penthouse right here in New York City, which is likely a bargain considering what real estate looks like right now in New York, Maria.</p><p>And those are your headlines.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Cheryl, thank you.</p><p>Well, we've got some Capitol Hill clashes to report. Attorney General Bill Barr delivering fiery testimony before the House Judiciary Committee yesterday. AG Barr going toe-to-toe with Democrats on several issues, from Russia meddling to ongoing protesters across the country.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Attorney General, the time is mine.</p><p>WILLIAM BARR, ATTORNEY GENERAL: You've waited to talk to me like this? You didn't need to wait so long.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When asked --</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Mr. Attorney General, you did answer the question. I'll be --</p><p>BARR: No, you said under penalty of perjury. I'm going to answer the damn question, OK?</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: But you said --</p><p>BARR: I've asked another U.S. attorney to look into the issue of unmasking because of, you know, the high number of unmaskings and some that do not readily appear to have been in the line of normal business.</p><p>REP. JIM JORDAN (R-OH): Wait a minute, so I want to be clear, so there is a -- there is another investigation on that issue specifically going on at the Justice Department right now.</p><p>BARR: Yes.</p><p>JORDAN: Can you give us that U.S. attorney's name or is that something you're comfortable doing?</p><p>BARR: John Basch of Texas.</p><p>Federal courts are under attack. Since when is it OK to try to bun down a federal court?</p><p>The U.S. Marshals have a duty to stop that and defend the courthouse. And that's what we are doing in Portland. We are at the courthouse defending the courthouse. We're not out looking for trouble.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Joining me right now, former White House deputy press secretary and Trump 2020 presidential campaign national press secretary, Hogan Gidley.</p><p>Hogan, it's great to see you again. Thanks so much for being here.</p><p>GIDLEY: Absolutely. Great to be with you. Thanks so much for the time.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So what was your reaction to that hearing yesterday? It felt like it was a whole lot of politics, frankly.</p><p>GIDLEY: It really was. And words like \"shameful\" and \"disgraceful\" and \"disgusting all come to mind and they're accurate, but they don't really do justice for what we saw yesterday. I mean the Democrats refusal to hear the truth, or even want to, is dangerous for the future of this country. I don't want to overstate that. I can't understate it because an American presidential campaign was spied upon by the government of the United States and they didn't want to hear about it.</p><p>Our city streets are devolving into lawlessness where there is rioting and looting and innocent Americans being dragged into the streets, beaten, simply for trying to protect their own businesses. And they call it a myth and don't want to hear the truth about churches being burned and buildings being burned? Ask the people who have lost their lives. Ask the people who have lost their businesses. Those sweet children in our -- in our -- in our big cities like New York being hit by stray bullets killed.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: Ask them if that's a myth.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: And the only person standing up to this is Donald Trump. He wants law and order. He wants safety and security in our city streets. And all Joe Biden does when he pops up out of his hidey hole is makes excuses and say defund the police. That's not a strategy that's going to work.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: And no American is going to appreciate that type of head in the sand mentality to ignore what's going on in our city streets and communities.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I mean, it really is extraordinary that you don't hear one Democrat raise the issues of what took place in 2016. I mean we know that there was criminality already. We know that one FBI agent changed evidence, you know, said that Carter Page wasn't an asset for the CIA when, in fact, he was. We know that two out of four of the -- of the FISA warrants unlawful. I mean we know all of this already. We know that there was leaking to Congress, there was lying to Congress, and yet not a word. It's really embarrassing, actually, that we would not all agree that we don't want the power in Washington to put their finger on the scale in a major presidential election, and then to call some of these things peaceful protests when they're not.</p><p>Do you think voters, at the end of the day, will hold them accountable for all of this?</p><p>GIDLEY: Yes, absolutely, they will. And, look, there was one Democrat saying something, thankfully, on your show because you pressed Valerie Jarrett yesterday and she said, that's four years ago. What are we worried about spying on -- on American citizens four years ago.</p><p>But I can tell you this, your American way of life is -- is not safe with Joe Biden. Your cultural is not safe with Joe Biden. His policies are absolutely set up to allow this lawlessness to continue. Donald Trump has been working with these mayors and these governor at the local level, trying to get federal assets into these cities to help with the protection effort. And you're seeing it time and time again. So many across this country are watching what's happening and they're saying, I don't want that to occur in my town, I don't want that in my community.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: But rest assured, it's coming because the Democrats aren't going to stand in the gap, Joe Biden sure isn't going to work to stop it but President Donald Trump will.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I'm going to get your take on the stimulus struggles, but before we do, Valerie Jarrett did join me yesterday and I asked her about President Trump's involvement in all this spying as there's lots of speculation about who knew what and when. Here is what she said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Did President Obama direct any of this?</p><p>VALERIE JARRETT: That's not how it works. That's not how our investigations work. That -- we leave that to the intelligence community to bring forward information and -- and -- and the dossier, I would imagine, would be one piece of a much bigger puzzle. And so if you're saying, is it important to make sure that there isn't influences -- and, actually, the Mueller report didn't conclude that there wasn't any wrongdoing. In fact, he was explicit in saying quite the opposite. And so I don't think we should read in where there hasn't been actually any conclusions to that effect yet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, I --</p><p>JARRETT: You're making statement that actually haven't been proven --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Just -- just to be clear --</p><p>JARRETT: (INAUDIBLE) based in fact.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And what I was saying was, just to be clear, Robert Mueller did say no collusion. Michael Horowitz did say no collusion --</p><p>GIDLEY: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet we're not seeing the admission from the media and we're not seeing admission from the Democrats, Hogan.</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, it -- it absolutely destroys their narrative that Donald Trump somehow colluded with a foreign entity. I mean what a -- with a bogus charge, what a complete and total lie.</p><p>We now know, because of released documents, thankfully, at the IG level, that in 2017, higher-ups in the FISA courts and other plays in the FBI knew that the sub sources were bogus --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>GIDLEY: That the whole dossier was built on a house of cards, a cornerstone of lies. And they kept moving forward with it anyway.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: And I shudder to think what would happen had Donald Trump not been elected president, we would never know the names of Peter Strzok and Lisa Page.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I know.</p><p>GIDLEY: We wouldn't know about the corruption of Comey, Clapper, Brennan.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You're right.</p><p>GIDLEY: And now we do. Donald Trump rooted out corruption in his first term. He's talked about draining the swamp, which he has done in this first term and he'll continue to do it till it's bone-dry in the end of the second.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>Well, what I -- what I always say is, look, if -- if a sitting president can be treated this way, that the FBI just investigates sitting presidents -- I mean they had wiretaps on Carter Page throughout 2017.</p><p>GIDLEY: That's right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Then the rest of us have no shot for any fairness.</p><p>GIDLEY: That's right. Absolutely.</p><p>BARTIROMO: If you've got an actual president of the United States, people being spied on.</p><p>Let me move on to the battle over the next round of Covid-19 and this aid that is so needed. Days after Republicans unveiled their proposal, Democrats and some Republicans are not sold on the proposal. President Trump is -- weighed in yesterday. Here's what he said.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: All of the people involved, Steve Mnuchin's done a great job. Keeps everybody together. Both Democrat and Republican. And we'll see. We want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the people. I want to do what's best for the economy, because that means jobs and lots of good things, all right?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this still back-and-forth fighting, are they going to get a deal done, Hogan, before they leave again on August 7th?</p><p>GIDLEY: Look, I sure hope so. The American people deserve it. This president has been fighting to make sure that in the -- in the face of this unforeseen, unprecedented virus that was sent here by China, that the American people are protected, that they're safe, that it's not just about health, it's about their well-being.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: And these stimulus checks, this money, these trillions of dollars we've infused into the bank accounts of so many Americans has really worked to keep this country going to some degree. It allows people to actually pay rent. It allows people to put food on the table in this --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: In this difficult time. This president's pushed for that at every single turn. Democrats, whether it's DACA, whether it's, you know, the riots and looting, whether it's this stimulus package and coronavirus, they want to play politics with it. They do not care about the future of the American people. They care about the future of their political power.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: You see it every day, and it's on display with this stimulus package. They push for green new deal nonsense in the first couple of trillion-dollar checks that went to, you know, destroy our economy. They're pushing for more craziness in this one as well. The fact is, this president is looking out for the people. He does it every single day. It was an honor for me to stand by his side while he did it. Now I'm fighting on the campaign side of it and watching it. And what I see now is what I saw then. He wants the American people's future safe and secure. He wants them healthy. And these types of battles with Capitol Hill prove the point --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: Somebody's in it for the American people and somebody's in it for politics.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Real -- real -- real quick -- yes, let me bring in Dagen McDowell real quick.</p><p>Go ahead, Dagen.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Hogan, then why is President Trump trailing Joe Biden, who has barely been out on the campaign trail and his only presence is really, you know, out of his house? He's trailing in national polls. He's trailing in all the swing state polls. And Valerie Jarrett pivots to the here and now because the number one issue for Americans is the coronavirus. It's not the economy. It's not even race relations. And according to the latest Fox News poll, President Trump trails Joe Biden on doing a better job on coronavirus by 17 points. Why isn't the president's message resonating then?</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, first of all, a lot of those polls are junk. We can talk about methodology and science on those who allow -- it's a -- it --</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, that's a cop-out. That's a cop-out and you know it. You can argue that they don't indicate how the election turns out. That's fine. But that's just a cop-out, Hogan.</p><p>GIDLEY: It's not a cop-out where the numbers bear out the fact that 10 percent more Democrats are surveyed in these polls than there were in 2016. That's just sheer mathematics. I can't change that. So they are skewed to the left for sure.</p><p>But if we're talking about coronavirus, that's the beauty of this election. So many times we're talking in the abstract, what would it look like if somebody were president. You don't have to guess what it would look like for pandemic responses under Joe Biden. He was in the office of the -- of the White House for eight years. And when H1N1, swine flu, hit this country, all he did was shut down testing and said we're not going to report because 60 million Americans have it, who cares.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Well, Hogan, these polls clearly -- these -- these polls clearly matter to you and the president --</p><p>GIDLEY: Of course.</p><p>MCDOWELL: Because he's changed his position and tone based on that very polling to focus more on virus because you're losing on that subject.</p><p>GIDLEY: I would disagree that he changed his tone. He's been talking about the safety and security of the American people from day one. We're the ones who mentioned the coronavirus in the -- the state of the Union at the first of the year. It was Joe Biden who said go out and party, everything's fine and called us xenophobic for shutting down travel into this country to protect and save lives. This bold, decisive action from this president --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: Saved American lives. And I promise you, as we get closer to the election and the American people start to drill down on this and see that elections are about choices, the choice is clear, if they want safety, security, health and well-being --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: It's Donald Trump, not Joe Biden.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I would just throw in, Dagen, I think we could probably handle dealing with the coronavirus and having that conversation, as well as dealing with the conversation of the massive wrongdoing that took place in 2016 and 2017. I understand Valerie Jarrett's pivot, but I think we can probably do both and ensure that we have fair elections --</p><p>MCDOWELL: But -- but they -- but one takes priority over the --</p><p>BARTIROMO: And you don't have a powerful person at the FBI putting his finger on the -- on the -- on the button.</p><p>MCDOWELL: But one takes -- but if you're -- if you want to get re-elected, the coronavirus, the American voter is saying that is the number one issue, so something has to take a priority.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>GIDLEY: Well, absolutely, but it is --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, sure, but that doesn't mean the Obama administration shouldn't answer for these questions. It doesn't mean the Obama administration should not be forced to answer what the heck happened in 2016 and why was there a whole story created of collusion that had the whole public going nuts for three years.</p><p>GIDLEY: Right. Look, while -- while the media -- while the media went from crisis to crisis, this president went from solution to solution. He's the one who's solving this, not the left, not the liberals, not Joe Biden. They don't have a plan. They don't have any ideas of how to fix this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Hogan, thank you so much.</p><p>Hogan Gidley.</p><p>We're looking at New York real estate next with Bill Rudin.</p><p>Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>Signed, sealed and leased. Some signs of hope for New York City's real estate market. Financial services giant Raymond James signing a major office lease for 160,000 square feet on Park Avenue, according to \"The New York Post.\" The Florida' based firm says it's consolidating smaller locations in Manhattan.</p><p>Joining me right now to talk more about the state of New York is one of the leading real estate companies, Rudin Management Company's CEO and Co- Chairman Bill Rudin.</p><p>Bill, it's great to have you this morning. Thanks so much for joining me.</p><p>BILL RUDIN, CEO AND CO-CHAIRMAN, RUDIN MANAGEMENT COMPANY: Good morning, Maria. Good to be with you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So I know that this pandemic has really changed the behaviors and the plans for a lot of people. Give us the state of affairs in New York right now in terms of commercial real estate. Are you seeing increasingly that companies are saying we don't need all of this space, we've got lots of people working from home? And give us the signs of hope that you may be seeing on the other side of that.</p><p>RUDIN: Well, you just -- at the top of the segment you mentioned about Raymond James. That's a very positive sign. On top of the announcement last week that AIG, the insurance giant, has signed a million square -- half a million square feet of leases, moving their headquarters right around the corner from Fox headquarters on Sixth Avenue at the old \"Time Life\" building. And they're expanding downtown.</p><p>Then we also have Bank National the Paribas BNP renewing their lease also not far from where your headquarters are on Seventh Avenue. And we're seeing companies start to dip their toe back in the water. These, you know, leases that were signed, you know, reaffirm that, but we're also seeing, now that we can -- we're back into phase four in terms of reopening, brokers are allowed to take their customers, with proper protocol, through spaces and we're seeing a significant increase in -- in touring. We're seeing people who were in negotiation in the -- in January, February, March who have stopped their deals now starting to revive it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Right.</p><p>RUDIN: We have a couple of deals in our portfolio.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right.</p><p>RUDIN: We're moving forward with a -- right around the corner again from you a major renovation at Three Times Square.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RUDIN: So, you know, what -- we're starting to see these green shoots happening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I want to see what it's going to look like. Bill, I want to see how we're going to change the workplace. Let's talk about that.</p><p>Slip in a short break and come right back.</p><p>More with Bill Rudin when we come right back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back.</p><p>We are back with Rudin Management Company CEO and Co-chairmen Bill Rudin.</p><p>Getting back to work. This pandemic rapidly reshaping how companies do business. Many shifting to working from home.</p><p>Bill, tell me about the changes that we're going to see in buildings. How does this retrofitting look different given these new worries about -- about social distancing amid Covid?</p><p>RUDIN: Well, we're going to -- we've already implemented all these protocols. You have to wear a mask when you come into our building. We have limitations on elevator occupancy. We have social distancing requirements within our space. And, you know, we have hand sanitizers and we constantly remind our tenants we have a -- a online notebook that we send to our tenants, you know, that explains to them what the rules are and I think everybody is retrofitting their spaces, putting up sneeze guards, making sure that everyone's safe. We've increased our filter capacities within our buildings. We're providing more fresh air.</p><p>So we're really focused on making sure that the environment that our tenants come back into is the safe as possibly can be. We have an app that we can provide information to our tenants. So we're finding people, as they start to onboard appreciate all the things that we're doing, and we're starting to see slowly increasing of people coming back to work.</p><p>You had a segment a minute ago about Starbucks reopening their stores.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RUDIN: That's very important. We need to have that activity on the -- on the street.</p><p>But, Maria, I think the key thing that we need in our city, and all cities across the country, you've mentioned many times this morning with Senator Coons and others, the federal Covid four relief bill. We -- cities and states are -- where -- we went from the worst state in terms of infections to the best state. We don't want this to come back to us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RUDIN: But we've taken severe budget hits.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>RUDIN: And that's going to happen all across the country. So we're encouraging every congressman and senator and the White House to get in a room and work out this deal and make sure that the American people get the relief that we all need to move our economy forward.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, obviously, New York needs help. A lot of states need help right now.</p><p>Bill, we'll be watching the developments. Thanks so much. Great insights from you, as always.</p><p>Bill Rudin.</p><p>More MORNINGS WITH MARIA right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thanks everybody, Dagen McDowell, Philip Wegmann, Scott Martin, great to see you.</p><p>Have a wonderful day everybody. Thank you for joining us. Varney &amp; Co. is up next.</p><p>Stu, take it away.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MRNGMA-2020072903cb231</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FOXBNT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60G4-6RT1-DXH2-612G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437059</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"7335\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>MORNINGS WITH MARIA</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 29, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000CFF3</classCode><className>GENERAL MOTORS CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC000299K</classCode><className>GENERAL ELECTRIC CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Kelly/Getty Images Virginia Tech's Justin Robinson looks to pass between a group of U.Va. defenders during the Hokies' 61-60 upset victory in overtime over the No. 2 Cavaliers in Charlottesville Saturday. With the loss, U.Va. will likely be denied the No. 1 rank in the next AP Top 25 poll, which was in reach after No. 1 Villanova's loss to St. John's Wednesday.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The path was almost clear Saturday night for Virginia to rise to No. 1 in the Associated Press men's basketball poll for the first time in more than 35 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Virginia Tech? Just a mere speed bump on No. 2 U.Va.'s way to the top after the way U.Va. boxed around the Hokies in January on their home court, right?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not quite.</p><p>U.Va. may fall short of its first No. 1 ranking since December 1982 by losing 61-60 in overtime to Tech, which did more than gain redemption for its 26-point loss last month to the Cavaliers. The Hokies might have punched their NCAA tournament ticket.</p><p>\"It's big,\" Tech guard Justin Robinson said of possibly denying U.Va. the chance to be No. 1.</p><p>\"We just played really well. I think it was huge for us to get a win like this on the road, especially against a good team like Virginia.\"</p><p>It took some uncharacteristic misses by U.Va.'s best free-throw shooter and some clutch plays in the closing seconds for Tech (18-7, 7-5 ACC) to snap a five-game losing streak dating back to 2011 against teams ranked No. 1 or No. 2. Kerry Blackshear Jr.'s follow basket with six seconds left in overtime provided the winning points.</p><p>Devon Hall, who led U.Va. (23-2, 12-1) with 16 points, entered the game having made 93.4 percent of his free throws this season and 27 consecutive. He missed the back end of a one-and-one with 29 seconds left when U.Va. was up 60-56, and he couldn't hit the front end of a one-and-one with 13 seconds remaining and the Cavaliers leading 60-59.</p><p>With Tech running out of chances after Hall missed the free throw with 29 seconds left, Hokies freshman Nickeil Alexander-Walker shot-faked from 3-point range, causing U.Va.'s De'Andre Hunter to fall down. Alexander-Walker responded by knocking down a 3 with Isaiah Wilkins flashing to the perimeter to get a hand in Alexander-Walker's face.</p><p>His shot cut U.Va.'s lead to one. It was the only basket he made in the second half.</p><p>\"I believed the whole time we were going to win that game,\" said Alexander-Walker, who had 12 points and made 4 of 6 shots from 3-point range. \"I knew that if I had the shot, I was going to come down and make it. Before I took it, I had nothing but confidence because I believed.\"</p><p>Tech's Justin Bibbs rebounded Hall's next missed free throw with 13 seconds left. Blackshear gave the Hokies their final lead when he swiped an offensive rebound off the glass and scored with six seconds left on the heels of a missed layup by Robinson, who led all scorers with 20 points to go along with seven assists and five turnovers.</p><p>\"I just hope we handle it in the right way,\" Tech coach Buzz Williams said regarding the upset. \"The margin in this league is unlike any time since I've been (at Tech). Everybody is just beating up everybody. ... We will have to be very mature in how we handle it going forward - still a long time to go.\"</p><p>While U.Va. let a late lead get away in overtime, the tables were turned in the final stages of regulation.</p><p>Blackshear scored his first points of the game on a three-point play with 3:53 left in the second half to put Tech ahead 47-45. He connected on a layup, got fouled in the process by Jerome and made the ensuing free throw.</p><p>Devin Wilson extended Tech's lead to 49-45 with 1:19 left when he got to the basket for a layup, but Jerome came up big in the closing minute.</p><p>Jerome scored on a layup with 52 seconds left to cut Tech's lead to two. His shot with 10 seconds left in regulation tied  the game 49-49.</p><p>VIRGINIA TECH 61, No. 2 VIRGINIA 60, OT</p><p>VIRGINIA TECH (18-7, 7-5 ACC): Robinson 7-17 3-4 20, Alexander-Walker 4-9 0-0 12, Wilson 2-2 2-2 7, Bibbs 3-7 0-0 8, Blackshear 3-10 1-2 7, Bede 0-0 0-0 0, Hill 0-0 0-0 0, Clarke 3-6 0-0 7.

This is a standardised and transparent process used in engineering to tackle problems that span multiple groups.</p><h>Google and China</h><p>Google search has been available to Chinese users before, but to keep the site open, Google self-censored results that the Chinese government didn't want its citizens to see.</p><p>That changed after <url normalizedValue=\"https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/01/new-approach-to-china.html\">sophisticated cyber attacks</url> began to be directed at Google's servers in 2009. Google decided that the cost of doing business in China was too high, and stopped censoring the search results.</p><p>As a result, in March 2010 <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Websites_blocked_in_mainland_China\">Google joined the list of internet services blocked by the Chinese government</url>. The list currently includes Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, Youtube, Dropbox and the websites of the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg and Reuters. </p><p>Google now appears to have changed its mind and decided that it will pay the price to do business in China. </p><p>The secret Project Dragonfly has been under development since early last year, but was accelerated after a meeting at the end of 2017 between <url normalizedValue=\"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/sundar-pichai-makes-strong-case-for-googles-return-to-china/articleshow/61910904.cms\">Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai</url> and a top Chinese government official. </p><p>The new search engine is planned to be launched within nine months, pending approval from Chinese officials.

The opposition raised a ruckus, and the company has been summoned by the parliamentary standing committee on information technology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A few privately-owned platforms now have huge power over the public sphere. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp and Instagram, has tried to cast itself as an innocent intermediary, an empty stage where users do their own thing, but in fact, it brokers our interactions. How they organise content, make it searchable, what is visible and heard \u2014 these are choices, and they have consequences.Social media companies profit from our engagement.</p><p>Left to themselves, their algorithms prioritise the stuff that spreads fastest \u2014 rage, hate, wacko conspiracy theories. These platforms are also hard to exit. Today, the price of being in touch with friends and family is to let yourself be under minute surveillance so others can sell to you.</p><p>These platforms are pretty proactive with taking down sexual content and graphic violence. While they also claim to prohibit hate speech, drawing lines through community flagging and editorial review is admittedly not easy in a hyper-partisan environment. It comes down to human and institutional choices. Around the world, they have evolved their own standards in response to public outcry and economic imperatives. In the cases pointed out by the Wall Street Journal, there is no ambiguity, they violate the company's own stated standards elsewhere.</p><p>European regulators have made Facebook act quickly on hate speech, compelled to respond to takedown requests within 24 hours. In Pakistan it takes down blasphemy, in Thailand, it rushes to scrub anything that criticises the royals. Goaded by governments, it also invests in counter-messaging. For instance, those who search for white supremacist content are now guided to a group called Life After Hate. In India, though, apparently, Facebook concluded in 2018 that a BJP leader's page (which he now disowns) calling Muslims traitors, threatening to demolish mosques, demanding that Rohingyas be shot, need not be acted on.</p><p>After the controversy, BJP leaders claimed that the Wall Street Journal expose is a left-wing attempt to censor right-wing speech in a free marketplace of ideas. But hate speech is not free speech, it undermines the very value of free speech, constricting the participation of vulnerable minorities. These are not 'mere words', or harmless rhetoric. This surround-sound, this constant demonising of Muslims has violent effects in the real world. As political theorist Bhikhu Parekh put it, if anything can be said about a group with impunity, anything can also be done to it.</p><p>To be fair, social media is only one part of modern propaganda infrastructures \u2014 it is not the source of our intense friction today. But it tends to encourage ideological extremes, as platforms like WhatsApp privately influence us, pander even to baseless beliefs, without the pushback that would have come in a common public forum. And it threatens democracy when it adds its firepower to an already asymmetric battleground.</p><p>Then again, where is the minimal shared threshold that deliberative democracy needs? After the Facebook story broke, the BJP claimed that the opposition was also spreading hate speech when Sonia Gandhi called for an 'aar paar ki ladaai', or Rahul Gandhi said that the public would attack the PM with sticks. This is just blurring the question: did Facebook decline to apply standards of hate speech for fear of offending the BJP? It is depressing but not surprising that an employee whose job it is to lobby the government would push for ignoring hate-speech from party members. But once exposed, the question is whether Facebook will double down and defend these choices in its biggest market or be held to a fair standard.</p><p>There is nothing wrong with partisan division. We have deep moral disagreements that don't have to be reconciled, as long as we accept that we are a part of a plural whole and don't try to annihilate the other. But now, we are steadily losing all \u201ccommon sense\u201d \u2014 shared norms that let us talk across our differences. Democracy cannot work in this disorientation, there can be no argument, no give and take.</p><p>In the US, big tech executives were grilled by their House antitrust committee, both Republicans and Democrats worry about their outsized power. In India, the force field is different. Here, Facebook is accused of aligning with a political side for its self-interest. A bargain between a communications colossus and a dominant ruling party/government that wants only its own voice heard might make excellent sense for both sides, but it's no good for democracy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TOIET-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOIET2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60NJ-JWR1-DXJR-H4V2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">382885</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"806\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Bennett Coleman &amp; Co.

Left to themselves, their algorithms prioritise the stuff that spreads fastest \u2014 rage, hate, wacko conspiracy theories. These platforms are also hard to exit. Today, the price of being in touch with friends and family is to let yourself be under minute surveillance so others can sell to you.</p><p>These platforms are pretty proactive with taking down sexual content and graphic violence. While they also claim to prohibit hate speech, drawing lines through community flagging and editorial review is admittedly not easy in a hyper-partisan environment.

An offshoot of the 1980s computer firm Acorn, it developed into the country's premier technology business, supplying microchips for most of the world's mobile phones. Its strategic importance was obvious, but in 2016, in the aftermath of the Brexit vote, it was taken over by the Japanese firm SoftBank for \u00a324billion.

There have been calls for the Government to halt the sale but now that ARM is no longer British-owned, the best ministers can do is seek job guarantees and the retention of a British HQ. Hermann Hauser, one of ARM's founders, has voiced concern that the American government's trade sanctions on countries including China will affect the sale of its microchips after the takeover.</p><p>It is a story often repeated. The UK is brilliant at innovating but not at turning firms into the international behemoths that the Americans produce. We can start up, but not scale up. Why is Nvidia taking over ARM and not vice versa? The reasons are cultural, financial and political.</p><p>British innovators are happy to cash in on their success without creating a Google or Facebook; venture capital, while available, is too cautiously invested, and politicians have failed to set out a coherent strategy for retaining tech businesses in Britain through low taxes and flexible regulation. We certainly need one now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TELEGR-163165389</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TELEGR2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60V8-C891-JCBW-N4R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8109</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"280\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (London)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30219\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>Edition 1, National Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 15, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>GOOGLE LLC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0001YLV</classCode><className>NVIDIA CORP</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

The views expressed are those of the author, not necessarily Mongabay. On a hot, muggy day in October, an exotic pet trapper in an Indonesian forest snatched a young Javan gibbon from its mother, stuffed the animal in a sack, and took to his heels. A day later, the gibbon, a protected species, was offered for sale on Facebook. A scroll down through the trafficker's timeline reveals more gibbons, birds, and other endangered species on offer. The sale of gibbons and endangered species is illegal under Indonesian law. In March of this year, traffickers in Indonesia were arrested and tried for the illegal sale of Komodo dragons on Facebook[1]. The same would not be true for another accomplice in this crime sequence: Facebook. When it comes to crime on social media, the enabler always walks free. It's time for regulators to take steps to hold online platforms accountable for facilitating the illegal trafficking of wildlife.Wildlife for sale on Facebook. Image courtesy of Daniel Stiles.For traffickers engaging in some of the world's biggest black-market trades, Facebook Inc. is the enabler. The company serves as a vehicle for thousands of traffickers who sell illegal goods using Facebook[2], WhatsApp, and Instagram[3] to market their goods, connect with and negotiate sales with buyers, and even receive payments. More than two decades ago, the U.S. Congress passed the Communications Decency Act (CDA), which included Section 230[4]. The bill was meant to mitigate the risk for firms of hosting third-party content on Internet platforms. Senator Ron Wyden, one of the bill's sponsors, said that CDA 230 was envisioned to provide a 'sword and a shield.'[5] The 'sword' was meant to enable technology firms to self-police content on their platforms as they saw fit. The shield provided those platforms with sweeping immunity from liability for content posted by third-parties. As it turned out, the sword was made of rubber while the shield was Teflon. Tech firms broadly \u2014 and Facebook in particular \u2014 failed to hold up their end of the bargain, however. Huge cyberspace marketplaces exist where buyers and sellers trade illegal products ranging from drugs[6], wildlife[7], antiquities[8], and human remains[9] to human beings[10] themselves. Facebook's closed and secret groups provide insulated environments for transnational criminals to connect, advertise, and move material. Facebook has a set of policies banning illegal activity, laid out in its Terms of Service[11] and Community Standards. But these are only as effective as their enforcement, and the company's content moderation leaves much to be desired.Wildlife for sale on a Facebook page that has since been inactivated. Image courtesy of Daniel Stiles.Facebook and other social media firms mainly rely on algorithms and artificial intelligence to moderate harmful content. But investigations by the Alliance to Counter Crime Online (ACCO)[12], where I am a contributing member, show time and again how these algorithms actually connect traffickers faster than moderators can remove their accounts. They suggest friends and recommend groups, putting illicit actors in touch with one another, continually expanding networks of users engaging in similar illegal activities. In response to increasing pressure from wildlife organizations, Facebook and Instagram banned the sale of all animals[13] in 2017. But a cursory search on either platform will turn up countless groups and individuals still advertising domestic and exotic pets, even zoo animals, for sale. Ivory and rhino horn are sold[14], using code words, in closed groups. The same is true on other online platforms such as Alibaba, Taobao (owned by Alibaba), Google, Baidu, and more. Along with Facebook and Instagram, these platforms are all founding members of the Global Coalition to End Wildlife Trafficking Online[15]. Launched in May 2018, the coalition's stated goal is to reduce online wildlife trafficking by 80 percent by 2020. The technology companies involved in the Coalition are very far from achieving that goal. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) has 183 Parties, countries that represent a majority of the world's nations. The organization, grappling with how to address wildlife cybercrime, recently introduced a revised resolution[16] that included key recommendations to deal with these online issues. The amended resolution was accepted, making clear that CITES Parties recognize that it is up to them and not to the online platforms to develop measures to control the illegal trade in wildlife. A crucial revision noted that the resolution recommends that Parties 'identify key contacts at online technology and data companies that can facilitate the provision of information upon request from Parties in support of investigations.' In November 2016, one such key contact emailed me after seeing an article in the New York Times[17] regarding my work identifying the role of Facebook Inc.'s platforms in the rampant illicit ape trade. Max Slackman, Facebook's animals policy manager, wrote to me, in part: 'We would like to learn more about your investigation and if there are additional learnings you can share . In the meantime, please send us over any Facebook and Instagram accounts, Pages, or groups that offer to sell endangered animals. We will investigate immediately.'An ad on a Chinese social media site. Image courtesy of Daniel Stiles.I sent him information and asked if there was any way that he or Facebook could help in the investigation of the dealers and assist in arrests and prosecutions. As ACCO researchers have pointed out time and again, closing accounts doesn't stop the trafficking \u2014 traffickers simply set up new accounts with tighter privacy. Not only that, but Facebook's practice of deleting accounts, rather than archiving and disabling them, erases years of valuable evidence that could actually help prosecute these criminals and impact the illicit trade. Slackman's response was one that we at ACCO have come to find typical of a company that is skirting responsibility for crime on its platforms: 'We do work with law enforcement through the warrant process and We try to make the process as easy as possible for law enforcement to produce legally sufficient warrants, but due to our privacy policy and requirements we are not able to share information about accounts with third parties.' While hiding behind the company's 'privacy policy,' Slackman essentially confirmed that Facebook does not take proactive measures to counter crime. His response framed the company's internal policies as a more powerful factor in their actions than the presence of activity that violates national and international laws.An ad on a Chinese social media site. Image courtesy of Daniel Stiles.Individuals selling illegal commodities online can be prosecuted, but there are not yet any legal pathways in the U.S. that formalize and regulate cooperation between online service providers and law enforcement, mainly due to privacy policies and regulations. The crux of the problem in getting effective cooperation from the titans of Silicon Valley to push illegal and dangerous activities offline is the uncomfortable fact that such cooperation conflicts with their business model. The online service providers make their money from user engagement and 'clicks,' whether it be to purchase a commodity, to read an advertisement, or, in the case of online black markets, do business with a trafficker. Any actions that service providers take to reduce user engagement reduces their bottom line. Big tech has made clear they aren't interested in wielding their sword. It's up to governments to enact legislation that compels social media firms to modify their algorithms to detect illegal activity instead of facilitating it. Facebook, Google, and other technology firms are sophisticated and rake in billions in annual revenue. They're more than capable of combating the crime on their platforms, but there's nothing in the law that requires them to do so. That needs to change. The U.S. Congress has started the discussion[18]. Other countries where online platforms are based that engage in illegal wildlife trade, particularly China, need to step up their enforcement actions as well. Legislatures will have to achieve the admittedly difficult task of assigning responsibility to online service providers to decide how to balance free speech, legitimate commerce, and user privacy against dangerous communications, illegal trade, and reporting user abuse to the appropriate national and international authorities. The current service provider response of simply removing posts or closing accounts does not solve the problem. Daniel Stiles is currently an independent wildlife trade investigator. He has conducted numerous investigations into illegal ivory, rhino horn, pangolin, great ape and big cat trade, funded by various United Nations agencies, IUCN, TRAFFIC, and many wildlife conservation NGOs. He has lived in Kenya since 1977. FEEDBACK: Use this form[19] to send a message to the author of this post. If you want to post a public comment, you can do that at the bottom of the page.

Take <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>which has long claimed that it's a tech platform, not a media entity. \"Don't be evil,\" Google would say to its employees, as though it were setting itself apart from other massive corporations.</p><p>But now, some policymakers are increasingly insisting that firms such as Google, <person><nameText>Facebook </nameText></person>and Twitter really aren't that special after all -- and that perhaps it's time they were held to the same standard that many Americans expect of electricity companies or internet service providers.</p><p>Sen. <person><nameText>Al Franken </nameText></person>(D-Minn.) became the latest and most vocal of these critics Wednesday when, at a Washington conference, he called for tech companies to follow the same net neutrality principles that the federal government has applied to broadband companies such as Verizon, AT&amp;T and Comcast.</p><p>\"We must now begin a thorough examination of big tech's practices in order to secure the free flow of information on the internet,\" Franken said at the event.</p><p>Franken followed up with an op-ed in the Guardian.</p><p>\"<person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google and Amazon, like ISPs, should be neutral in their treatment of the flow of lawful information and commerce on their platforms,\" Franken wrote.</p><p>The double-barreled critique of major tech firms as nonneutral entities cuts against Silicon Valley's longtime message to the country and reflects the growing skepticism in Washington toward the industry.</p><p>Tech companies such as Twitter have advocated forcefully for strong net neutrality rules, arguing that without them, internet service providers could manipulate what internet users can see and do online.</p><p>\"Without net neutrality in force, ISPs would even be able to block content they don't like, reject apps and content that compete with their own offerings, and arbitrarily discriminate against particular content providers by prioritizing certain Internet traffic over theirs,\" Twitter wrote in a blog post this year.</p><p>Spokesmen for Amazon and Twitter declined to comment. <person><nameText>Facebook, </nameText></person>Google, Netflix and the Internet Assn., an industry trade group, didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. (Amazon.com founder and Chief Executive Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post.)</p><p>Tech companies have been wary of being regulated like other industries. When federal officials sought to give consumers more privacy protections in 2016 by applying new limits on how internet service providers could mine and share customer data, Silicon Valley firms approached the proposal cautiously, analysts said, because they feared that such regulation could someday extend to cover their own data-driven ad businesses too.</p><p>Other policymakers, such as Rep. Marsha Blackburn (R-Ky.), have proposed similar privacy legislation that would affect internet service providers and tech companies equally. Although that bill has largely stalled, it -- together with Franken's speech -- shows members of both parties are interested in regulating tech companies as supposedly neutral conduits.</p><p>The tech industry's positive reputation in Washington until recently has helped inoculate it from regulatory pressure, some analysts say. But the political winds have turned as Americans have learned more about Silicon Valley's role in the 2016 election, and that could expose the industry to stricter rules.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LATE-9V2QLR64</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LAT2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PXR-51B1-JBFS-C30F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">306909</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"552\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Los Angeles Times All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Los Angeles Times</publicationName><edition>Home Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>November 11, 2017 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Wire</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>CC00055NZ</classCode><className>GOOGLE INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC000CFK7</classCode><className>TWITTER INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC00026NE</classCode><className>AMAZON.COM INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0002AQO</classCode><className>NETFLIX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>TWTR (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>AMZN (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NFLX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>FRANKEN, AL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>INTERNET (COMPUTER NETWORK)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>CORPORATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>MEDIA INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>GOVERNMENT REGULATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem><className>Computer &amp;

Admittedly none of us will be going on holiday for a while, at least not if the outspoken Transport Secretary has anything to do with it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Shapps sent the travel industry into collective meltdown last week when he<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/17/travel-industry-hits-government-minister-warns-people-not-book/\">advised the great British public against booking a summer holiday this year</url>. Industry body ABTA accused him of being \"thoughtless\" but surely it was perfectly sensible advice? It would be madness to make travel plans until restrictions are lifted.</p><p>In the meantime, struggling tour operators and airlines are making a strong case for a government bailout by systematically legging over customers who have had holidays and flights cancelled.</p><p>According to Which?, 20 of the UK's largest operators are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/17/travel-industry-hits-government-minister-warns-people-not-book/\">illegally withholding refunds that should be paid within a fortnight</url>and offering vouchers or credit instead. People are also struggling to obtain refunds online or get through on the phone ask for their money back.</p><p>Ryanair, never one to miss an opportunity to squeeze a few more quid out of holidaymakers, has begun telling customers that they will have to wait until the pandemic has passed if they want a refund. Yet, the most egregious case must surely be that of Travel Trolley, which is charging customers a \u00a375 \"administration fee\" if they want their refund in cash. The firm is owned by multi-millionaire Kuljinder Bahia, who is estimated to be worth \u00a3430m.</p><p>When travellers are being treated with such contempt, how many of us will be rushing to give them our hard-earned money once travel restrictions are eased? According to estimates, up to \u00a37bn could be owed for cancelled trips. The sector defends such action, arguing that many operators would collapse if they have to meet all refunds now because revenue has evaporated.</p><p>That may be true but it's not up to consumers to prop up failing airlines and travel agents, particularly when millions are facing their own financial hardship. If the big names can't afford reimbursements then they should be turning to shareholders, not leaning on cash-strapped customers.</p><p>Still, it is hardly a surprise. The travel industry has always lived on the never-never, bankrolling day-to-day operations, debt interest payments and even shareholder dividends with customer deposits rather than that money being held in escrow accounts. The simple reason why travel companies can't meet refund requests is that much of the cash has already been spent.</p><p>Meanwhile, the National Audit Office has admitted that the lifeboat scheme ATOL is in danger of capsizing after stepping in when Thomas Cook went under. Any government rescue should be conditional on an end to consumers being taken for a ride.</p><p>Vodafone's lessons for Facebook</p><p>The Indian telecom market is not for the faint-hearted. Vodafone will attest to that. Despite racking up a (EURO)19bn bill trying to go toe-to-toe with powerful industrialist Mukesh Ambani, the FTSE 100 operator has warned that its ill-fated Indian venture is staring bankruptcy in the face.</p><p>The reality is that it is impossible to compete with India's richest man, while the country's government, regulators, and courts, continue to act in his favour. Even Vodafone, one of the world's biggest telecoms providers, has practically been chased out of the country.</p><p>Still, there's another way, as Mark Zuckerberg has shown: if you can't beat 'em, join 'em. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/04/17/travel-industry-hits-government-minister-warns-people-not-book/\">Facebook has just taken a $5.7bn stake in Ambani's internet operation Jio Platforms</url>, handing it a 10pc slice of the company.</p><p>It's a smart move. By offering unlimited data and calls for just a few dollars a month Jio has managed to become India's largest carrier, in a market offering almost unmatched potential.</p><p>Vodafone should have bowed out years ago but the promise of vast riches persuaded it to double down on more than one occasion. India has a population of 1.3bn, half of whom are under 25; smartphone penetration is just 35pc; and there is no chance of a fixed-line network ever being built to service the country's internet needs. Facebook is massive in India where more than 300m use its core social network. WhatsApp offers even more potential; 400m people in the country use its global messaging app and it has become the go-to digital platform for many of India's small business owners.</p><p>The digital Shangri-La for both sides would be to pair the service with Jio's new online grocery venture, Jiomart, so that customers can buy goods via WhatsApp. Even a global health emergency can't slow the march of big tech.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TLGRWB-62322964</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TLGRWB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YR7-FK71-F021-62PD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389195</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"810\"/><timeReceived>9:48 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Telegraph Media Group Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>telegraph.co.uk</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"1845\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 22, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper; Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00092L8</classCode><className>WHICH?

Working seven-day weeks for months on end, they fear pay freezes, public backlash and even losing their jobs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since 2010, spending for state public health departments has dropped by 16% per capita and spending for local health departments has fallen by 18%, according to a KHN and Associated Press analysis of government spending on public health. At least 38,000 state and local public health jobs have disappeared since the 2008 recession, leaving a skeletal workforce for what was once viewed as one of the world's top public health systems.</p><p>KHN, also known as Kaiser Health News, and AP interviewed more than 150 public health workers, policymakers and experts, analyzed spending records from hundreds of state and local health departments, and surveyed statehouses. On every level, the investigation found, the system is underfunded and under threat, unable to protect the nation's health.</p><p>Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said in an interview in April that his \"biggest regret\" was \"that our nation failed over decades to effectively invest in public health.\"</p><p>So when this outbreak arrived - and when, according to public health experts, the federal government bungled its response - hollowed-out state and local health departments were ill-equipped to step into the breach.</p><p>Over time, their work had received so little support that they found themselves without direction, disrespected, ignored, even vilified. The desperate struggle against COVID-19 became increasingly politicized and grew more difficult.</p><p>States, cities and counties in dire straits have begun laying off and furloughing their limited staff, and even more devastation looms, as states reopen and cases surge. Historically, even when money pours in following crises such as Zika and H1N1, it disappears after the emergency subsides. Officials fear the same thing is happening now.</p><p>\"We don't say to the fire department, 'Oh, I'm sorry. There were no fires last year, so we're going to take 30% of your budget away.' That would be crazy, right?\" said Dr. Gianfranco Pezzino, the health officer in Shawnee County, Kansas. \"But we do that with public health, day in and day out.\"</p><p>Ohio's Toledo-Lucas County Health Department spent $17 million, or $40 per person, in 2017.</p><p>Jennifer Gottschalk, 42, works for the county as an environmental health supervisor. When the coronavirus struck, the county's department was so short-staffed that her duties included overseeing campground and pool inspections, rodent control and sewage programs, while also supervising outbreak preparedness for a community of more than 425,000 people.</p><p>When Gottschalk and five colleagues fell ill with COVID-19, she found herself fielding calls about a COVID-19 case from her hospital bed, then working through her home isolation. She only stopped when her coughing was too severe to talk on calls.</p><p>\"You have to do what you have to do to get the job done,\" Gottschalk said.</p><p>Now, after months of working with hardly a day off, she says the job is wearing on her. So many lab reports on coronavirus cases came in, the office fax machine broke. She faces a backlash from the community over coronavirus restrictions and there are countless angry phone calls.</p><p>Things could get worse; possible county budget cuts loom.</p><p>But Toledo-Lucas is no outlier. Public health ranks low on the nation's financial priority list. Nearly two-thirds of Americans live in counties that spend more than twice as much on policing as they spend on nonhospital health care, which includes public health.</p><p>More than three-quarters of Americans live in states that spend less than $100 per person annually on public health. Spending ranges from $32 in Louisiana to $263 in Delaware, according to data provided to KHN and AP by the State Health Expenditure Dataset project.</p><p>That money represents less than 1.5% of most states' total spending, with half of it passed down to local health departments.</p><p>The share of spending devoted to public health belies its multidimensional role. Agencies are legally bound to provide a broad range of services, from vaccinations and restaurant inspections to protection against infectious disease. Distinct from the medical care system geared toward individuals, the public health system focuses on the health of communities at large.</p><p>\"Public health loves to say: When we do our job, nothing happens. But that's not really a great badge,\" said Scott Becker, chief executive officer of the Association of Public Health Laboratories. \"We test 97% of America's babies for metabolic or other disorders. We do the water testing. You like to swim in the lake and you don't like poop in there? Think of us.\"</p><p>But the public doesn't see the disasters they thwart. And it's easy to neglect the invisible.</p><p>The local health department was a well-known place in the 1950s and 1960s, when Harris Pastides, president emeritus of the University of South Carolina, was growing up in New York City.</p><p>\"My mom took me for my vaccines. We would get our injections there for free. We would get our polio sugar cubes there for free,\" said Pastides, an epidemiologist. \"In those days, the health departments had a highly visible role in disease prevention.\"</p><p>The United States' decentralized public health system, which matches federal funding and expertise with local funding, knowledge and delivery, was long the envy of the world, said Saad Omer, director of the Yale Institute for Global Health.</p><p>\"A lot of what we're seeing right now could be traced back to the chronic funding shortages,\" Omer said. \"The way we starve our public health system, the way we have tried to do public health outcomes on the cheap in this country.\"</p><p>In Scott County, Indiana, when preparedness coordinator Patti Hall began working at the health department 34 years ago, it ran a children's clinic and a home health agency with several nurses and aides. But over time, the children's clinic lost funding and closed. Medicare changes paved the way for private services to replace the home health agency. Department staff dwindled in the 1990s and early 2000s. The county was severely outgunned when rampant opioid use and needle sharing sparked an outbreak of HIV in 2015.</p><p>Besides just five full-time and one part-time county public health positions, there was only one doctor in the outbreak's epicenter of Austin. Indiana's then-Gov. Mike Pence, now leading the nation's coronavirus response as vice president, waited 29 days after the outbreak was announced to sign an executive order allowing syringe exchanges. At the time, a state official said that only five people from agencies across Indiana were available to help with HIV testing in the county.</p><p>The HIV outbreak exploded into the worst ever to hit rural America, infecting more than 230 people.</p><p>At times, the federal government has promised to support local public health efforts, to help prevent similar calamities. But those promises were ephemeral.</p><p>Two large sources of money established after Sept. 11, 2001 - the Public Health Emergency Preparedness program and the Hospital Preparedness Program - were gradually chipped away.</p><p>The Affordable Care Act established the Prevention and Public Health Fund, which was supposed to reach $2 billion annually by 2015. The Obama administration and Congress raided it to pay for other priorities, including a payroll tax cut. The Trump administration is pushing to repeal the ACA, which would eliminate the fund, said Carolyn Mullen, senior vice president of government affairs and public relations at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.</p><p>Former Iowa Sen. Tom Harkin, a Democrat who championed the fund, said he was furious when the Obama White House took billions from it, breaking what he said was an agreement.</p><p>\"I haven't spoken to Barack Obama since,\" Harkin said.</p><p>If the fund had remained untouched, an additional $12.4 billion would eventually have flowed to local and state health departments.</p><p>But local and state leaders also did not prioritize public health over the years.</p><p>In Florida, for example, 2% of state spending goes to public health. Spending by local health departments in the state fell 39%, from a high of $57 in inflation-adjusted dollars per person in the late 1990s to $35 per person last year.</p><p>In North Carolina, Wake County's public health workforce dropped from 882 in 2007 to 614 a decade later, even as the population grew by 30%.</p><p>In Detroit, the health department had 700 employees in 2009, then was effectively disbanded during the city's bankruptcy proceedings. It's been built back up, but today still has only 200 workers for 670,000 residents.</p><p>Many departments rely heavily on disease-specific grant funding, creating unstable and temporary positions. The CDC's core budget, some of which goes to state and local health departments, has essentially remained flat for a decade. Federal money currently accounts for 27% of local public health spending.</p><p>Years of such financial pressure increasingly pushed workers in this predominantly female workforce toward retirement or the private sector and kept potential new hires away.</p><p>More than a fifth of public health workers in local or regional departments outside big cities earned $35,000 or less a year in 2017, as did 9% in big city departments, according to research by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials and the de Beaumont Foundation.</p><p>Even before the pandemic, nearly half of public health workers planned to retire or leave their organizations for other reasons in the next five years. Poor pay topped the list of reasons.</p><p>Armed with a freshly minted bachelor's degree, Julia Crittendon took a job two years ago as a disease intervention specialist with Kentucky's state health department. She spent her days gathering detailed information about people's sexual partners to fight the spread of HIV and syphilis. She tracked down phone numbers and drove hours to pick up reluctant clients.</p><p>The mother of three loved the work, but made so little money that she qualified for Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for America's poorest. Seeing no opportunity to advance, she left.</p><p>\"We're like the redheaded stepchildren, the forgotten ones,\" said Crittendon, 46.</p><p>Such low pay is endemic, with some employees qualifying for the nutrition program for new moms and babies that they administer. People with the training for many public health jobs, which can include a bachelor's or master's degree, can make much more money in the private health care sector, robbing the public departments of promising recruits.</p><p>Dr. Tom Frieden, a former CDC director, said the agency \"intentionally underpaid people\" in a training program that sent early-career professionals to state and local public health departments to build the workforce.</p><p>\"If we paid them at the very lowest level at the federal scale,\" he said in an interview, \"they would have to take a 10-20% pay cut to continue on at the local health department.\"</p><p>As low pay sapped the workforce, budget cuts sapped services.</p><p>In Alaska, the Division of Public Health's spending dropped 9% from 2014 to 2018 and staffing fell by 82 positions in a decade to 426. Tim Struna, chief of public health nursing in Alaska, said declines in oil prices in the mid-2010s led the state to make cuts to public health nursing services. They eliminated well-child exams for children over 6, scaled back searches for the partners of people with certain sexually transmitted infections and limited reproductive health services to people 29 and younger.</p><p>Living through an endless stream of such cuts and their aftermath, those workers on the ground grew increasingly worried about mustering the \"surge capacity\" to expand beyond their daily responsibilities to handle inevitable emergencies.</p><p>When the fiercest of enemies showed up in the U.S. this year, the depleted public health army struggled to hold it back.</p><p>As the public health director for the Kentucky River District Health Department in rural Appalachia, Scott Lockard is battling the pandemic with 3G cell service, paper records and one-third of the employees the department had 20 years ago.</p><p>He redeployed his nurse administrator to work round-the-clock on contact tracing, alongside the department's school nurse and the tuberculosis and breastfeeding coordinator. His home health nurse, who typically visits older patients, now works on preparedness plans. But residents aren't making it easy on them.</p><p>\"They're not wearing masks, and they're throwing social distancing to the wind,\" Lockard said in mid-June, as cases surged. \"We're paying for it.\"</p><p>Even with more staff since the HIV outbreak, Indiana's Scott County Health Department employees worked evenings, weekends and holidays to deal with the pandemic, including outbreaks at a food packing company and a label manufacturer. Indiana spends $37 a person on public health.</p><p>\"When you get home, the phone never stops, the emails and texts never stop,\" said Hall, the preparedness coordinator.</p><p>All the while, she and her colleagues worry about keeping HIV under control and preventing drug overdoses from rising. Other health problems don't just disappear because there is a pandemic.</p><p>\"We've been used to being able to `MacGyver' everything on a normal day, and this is not a normal day,\" said Amanda Mehl, the public health administrator for Boone County, Illinois, citing a TV show.</p><p>Pezzino, whose department in Kansas serves Topeka and Shawnee County, said he had been trying to hire an epidemiologist, who would study, track and analyze data on health issues, since he came to the department 14 years ago. Finally, less than three years ago, they hired one. She just left, and he thinks it will be nearly impossible to find another.</p><p>While epidemiologists are nearly universal in departments serving large populations, hardly any departments serving smaller populations have one. Only 28% of local health departments have an epidemiologist or statistician.</p><p>Strapped departments are now forced to spend money on contact tracers, masks and gloves to keep their workers safe and to do basic outreach.</p><p>Melanie Hutton, administrator for the Cooper County Public Health Center in rural Missouri, pointed out the local ambulance department got $18,000, and the fire and police departments got masks to fight COVID-19.</p><p>\"For us, not a nickel, not a face mask,\" she said. \"We got (5) gallons of homemade hand sanitizer made by the prisoners.\"</p><p>Public health workers are leaving in droves. At least 34 state and local public health leaders have announced their resignation, retired or been fired in 17 states since April, a KHN/AP review found. Others face threats and armed demonstrators.</p><p>Ohio's Gottschalk said the backlash has been overwhelming.</p><p>\"Being yelled at by residents for almost two hours straight last week on regulations I cannot control left me feeling completely burned out,\" she said in mid-June.</p><p>Many are putting their health at risk. In Prince George's County, Maryland, public health worker Chantee Mack died after, family and co-workers believe, she and several colleagues contracted the disease in the office.</p><p>Pence, in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal on June 16, said the public health system was \"far stronger\" than it was when coronavirus hit.</p><p>It's true that the federal government this year has allocated billions for public health in response to the pandemic, according to the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. That includes more than $13 billion to state and local health departments, for activities including contact tracing, infection control and technology upgrades.</p><p>A KHN/AP review found that some state and local governments are also pledging more money for public health. Alabama's budget for next year, for example, includes $35 million more for public health than it did this year.</p><p>But overall, spending is about to be slashed again as the boom-bust cycle continues.</p><p>In most states, the new budget year begins July 1, and furloughs, layoffs and pay freezes have already begun in some places. Tax revenues evaporated during lockdowns, all but ensuring there will be more. At least 14 states have already cut health department budgets or positions or were actively considering such cuts in June, according to a KHN/AP review.</p><p>Since the pandemic began, Michigan temporarily cut most of its state health workers' hours by one-fifth. Pennsylvania required more than 65 of its 1,200 public health workers to go on temporary leave, and others lost their jobs. Knox County, Tennessee, furloughed 26 out of 260 workers for eight weeks.</p><p>Frieden, formerly of the CDC, said it's \"stunning\" that the U.S. is furloughing public health workers amid a pandemic. The country should demand the resources for public health, he said, just the way it does for the military.</p><p>\"This is about protecting Americans,\" Frieden said.</p><p>Cincinnati temporarily furloughed approximately 170 health department employees.</p><p>Robert Brown, chair of Cincinnati's Primary Care Board, questions why police officers and firefighters didn't face similar furloughs at the time or why residents were willing to pay hundreds of millions in taxes over decades for the Bengals' football stadium.</p><p>\"How about investing in something that's going to save some lives?\" he asked.</p><p>In 2018, Boston spent five times as much on its police department as its public health department. The city recently pledged to transfer $3 million from its approximately $60 million police overtime budget to its public health commission.</p><p>Looking ahead, more cuts are coming. Possible budget shortfalls in Brazos County, Texas, may force the health department to limit its mosquito-surveillance program and eliminate up to one-fifth of its staff and one-quarter of immunization clinics.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/07/30/theres-a-lot-we-still-dont-know-about-kids-and-covid-19/\"> There's a lot we still don't know about kids and COVID-19 </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/07/30/thursday-coronavirus-update-5-more-mn-deaths-745-new-cases/\"> Thursday coronavirus update: 5 more MN deaths, 745 new cases </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/07/30/top-mayo-clinic-researcher-leaves-in-wake-of-bullying-accusations/\"> Top Mayo Clinic researcher leaves in wake of bullying accusations </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/07/29/lawmakers-batter-big-tech-ceos-but-dont-land-many-blows/\"> Lawmakers batter Big Tech CEOs, but don't land many blows </url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.twincities.com/2020/07/29/house-orders-broad-mask-mandates-after-gohmert-gets-virus/\"> House orders broad mask mandates after Gohmert gets virus </url></p><p>Months into the pandemic response, health departments are still trying to ramp up to fight COVID-19. Cases are surging in states including Texas, Arizona and Florida.</p><p>Meanwhile, childhood vaccinations began plunging in the second half of March, according to a CDC study analyzing supply orders. Officials worry whether they will be able to get kids back up to date in the coming months. In Detroit, the childhood vaccination rate dipped below 40%, as clinics shuttered and people stayed home, creating the potential for a different outbreak.</p><p>Cutting or eliminating non-COVID activities is dangerous, said E. Oscar Alleyne, chief of programs and services at the National Association of County and City Health Officials. Cuts to programs such as diabetes control and senior nutrition make already vulnerable communities even more vulnerable, which makes them more likely to suffer serious complications from COVID. Everything is connected, he said.</p><p>It could be a year before there's a widely available vaccine. Meanwhile, other illnesses, including mental health problems, are smoldering.</p><p>The people who spend their lives working in public health say the temporary coronavirus funds won't fix the eroded foundation entrusted with protecting the nation's health as thousands continue to die.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STPLPP-3660496</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STPAULPMNG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6084-K0J1-JCX4-6167-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">313961</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3300\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 St. Paul Pioneer Press All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>St. Paul Pioneer Press (Minnesota)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 1, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC000262S</classCode><className>ASSOCIATED PRESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL &amp;

Also: California\u2019s unhappy boom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Good morning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(If you want to get California Today delivered to your inbox, here\u2019s <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">the sign-up</url>.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Early this year, I asked <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Pui-Wing Tam</url>, our Tech editor, to look back at 2018 and to predict some of 2019\u2019s biggest story lines. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As we get ready to close out 2019, I asked her for some updates. Here\u2019s what she said: </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">At the beginning of 2019,</url> you said one overarching story your team would be following was a growing tech backlash. What were some of the most important developments in that area this year and why?</p><p>So we were both right and wrong. While a backlash did grow against tech in some significant ways in 2019, it also didn\u2019t in other notable ways.</p><p>Here\u2019s what I mean: In Washington, lawmakers and regulators clearly took on big tech in 2019. Federal agencies like the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission began <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">antitrust investigations of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple</url>, as did state attorneys general and Congress.</p><p>Even in the heart of the tech industry \u2014 in Silicon Valley and in Seattle \u2014 we saw growing dissatisfaction among workers. A kind of backlash by insiders, if you will. Tech employees gave their bosses a hard time over issues such as <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">climate change</url> and unionization. Companies are still dealing with that elevated level of activism and outspokenness.</p><p>But here\u2019s where the backlash stopped. Did most of us drop our use of Google searches or Instagram posting or Amazon purchases or using iPhones? Not in the least. So we continue relying on these big tech companies. And as a result, they continue to mint money and to watch their <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">stock prices go up</url> and up and up.</p><p>What story or finding from your team most surprised you this year and why?</p><p>Technology can still wow us with milestones, in a \u201cHoly multiverse!\u201d sort of way.</p><p>Probably the most mind-bending development this year was when <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Google made a quantum breakthrough</url>. Essentially, the internet giant created a new kind of computer that could make calculations at unbelievable speeds. My colleague       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Cade Metz</url> wrote of the achievement: \u201cThe Google device did in 3 minutes 20 seconds a mathematical calculation that supercomputers could not complete in 10,000 years.\u201d</p><p>Whoa, right? As for how exactly this worked, I can tell you it involves qubits and subatomic levels and extremely cold temperatures. Cade asked a few quantum experts to describe it all in 280 characters, so read about it <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">here</url>.</p><p>This year, we\u2019ve seen a lot of high-profile tech companies flail financially \u2014 most notably <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Uber, with its disastrous I.P.O</url>. That signaled a major shift. (Like, now it\u2019s important to investors that       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">companies actually make money</url>?) What can we expect on that front in 2020?</p><p>That there won\u2019t be a black-and-white answer to whether the start-up bubble has popped or not.</p><p>Certainly high-profile tech I.P.O.s flopped this year and people in Silicon Valley didn\u2019t get quite <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">as rich as they expected</url> (cue the small violin). But there\u2019s still a lot of money sloshing around in tech start-up land and it isn\u2019t likely to just disappear anytime soon.</p><p>So we\u2019ll be watching a few barometers for where things go. Will <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Airbnb go public in 2020</url> and if so, how will it fare? How will other companies funded by       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">SoftBank</url>, the Japanese conglomerate that invested huge sums into Uber and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">WeWork</url> and others, do? And so on.</p><p>Even if the rubber meets the road in 2020, there will most likely be glimmers of the next big thing. Back during the dot-com implosion in the early 2000s, Google was just getting going. And we all know how it has since become a dominant force in many of our lives.</p><p>What else will your team be watching in 2020?</p><p>So much to watch! The most obvious is the 2020 election. The pressure is on social media in the next year to eliminate meddlers and misinformation around political candidates and their campaigns, especially after Russians used <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/newsletters/california-today\">Facebook</url>, YouTube, Twitter and other platforms to inflame voters in 2016.</p><p>Here\u2019s what else you need to get caught up</p><p>We often link to sites that limit access for nonsubscribers.

But Bezos' Los Angeles concerns--Amazon Studios, IMDb and Ring, among others, all have large offices in L.A. County--are high-profile enough to merit a sprawling, showcase compound.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Convenience and security aside, the trophy property is also a savvy branding move that adds a dash of Hollywood pedigree to his tech company's entertainment businesses.</p><p>But the world's richest man--worth a reported $200 billion, according to Forbes -is not alone. He's among a group of superwealthy who spend time in Los Angeles for work or play but officially live elsewhere.</p><p>Call them outsiders, if you will, but many of these ultra-rich, part-time Angelenos have a large presence here, and they often contribute more than most full-time residents.</p><p>Like Bezos, former Microsoft Corp. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's main residence is in Washington. He officially calls Hunts Point home, which is just up the road from Bezos' place in Medina.</p><p>As the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers since 2014 and the Forum since March, Ballmer is an outsider with an outsized profile in the Los Angeles community.</p><p>He wields his local influence generously asa team owner, business mogul and philanthropist. Besides developing the Inglewood Basketball and Entertainment Center and working with USC-incubated startups like Second Spectrum Inc. on augmented reality game-viewing apps such as Courtvision, Ballmer is heavily involved in philanthropy.</p><p>The Ballmer Group foundation, which he co-founded with his wife, Connie, has donated more than $130 million to charitable organizations across the Los Angeles area, including more than 34 groups working toward racial equity in mostly Black communities.</p><p>He's proactive and timely, recently donating $1 million in Covid-related aid to local community groups, including the Los Angeles Unified School District and homeless support organization Brilliant Corners.</p><p>Together with the Clippers Foundation, Ballmer and his wife gave $10 million to the Los Angeles Parks Foundation to fix up 350 public basketball courts across the city.</p><p>Regardless of where he hangs his hat, Ballmer's footprint in Los Angeles is bigger than many other permanent and part-time residents, although, to be fair, the Bezos Day 1 Families Fund last year donated nearly $14 million to local organizations that are tackling homelessness.</p><p>Stadium builder</p><p>Ballmer isn't the first or only out-of-town team owner, but with a net worth of $71.5 billion, according to Forbes, he is certainly one of the richer ones. Still very wealthy with an estimated net worth of $8.3 billion is Stan Kroenke, the Business Journal's 2020 Business Person of the Year and also a big name in L.A. sports.</p><p>The real estate mogul--who married Walmart Inc. heir Ann Walton--not only brought the Los Angeles Rams back to town in 2016 after more than 20 years in St. Louis but also teamed up with Stockbridge Capital Group to build the 70,000-seat SoFi Stadium.</p><p>While Kroenke and his wife have two properties in Beverly Hills, a compound in Malibu, and two children who also live in the Los Angeles area, their official residence is the historic 535,000-acre Waggoner Ranch in Electra, Texas, where there are no state income taxes.</p><p>Similarly, Colorado billionaire Philip Anschutz'sL.A.-based venue and event management company ASM Global has ownership stakes in the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Kings and Los Angeles Galaxy, as well as Staples Center, L.A. Live, the Greek Theatre and Dignity Health Sports Park.</p><p>That's a massive presence in the city for Anschutz, who is worth a reported $10.1 billion and was once dubbed \"the man who owns L.A.\" by The New Yorker. But he has always kept a low profile regarding his holdings here. Anschutz may have helped kick-start downtown L.A.'s renaissance with the Staples Center development but he is still primarily associated with his Denver home.</p><p>Media titans</p><p>Sports team ownership looms large as a draw for L.A.'s part-time ultra-wealthy, but other techies besides Bezos and Ballmer are spending more time here despite officially living elsewhere.</p><p>Worth an estimated $5.1 billion, former Hewlett-Packard and eBay Inc. Chief Executive Meg Whitman still shares a home with neurosurgeon husband Griffith Harsh IV in the pricey Silicon Valley town of Atherton but has spent a good chunk of the past two years in Los Angeles working on the launch of Hollywood-based mobile video streaming service Quibi, where she is CEO.</p><p>Until March 16, when Quibi's offices went fully remote to comply with stay-at-home regulations, anyone swimming in UCLA's pool at 6 a.m. could have run into Whitman, according to The Verge.</p><p>She listed her two-bedroom condo in West Hollywood's Sierra Towers on Aug. 10 for $6.5 million, but it's unclear whether Whitman is moving to another residence in Los Angeles.</p><p>Not all traditional media and entertainment moguls who spend a lot of time in Los Angeles call it home, either. Oprah Winfrey's OWN is based out of The Lot Studios in West Hollywood, but the media titan, who is worth are ported $2.6 billion, has called \"The Promised Land,\" her 70-acre Georgian-style estate in Montecito, home since 2001.</p><p>South Korean \"Parasite\" producer Miky Lee, who grew her grandfather's CJ Group into a $4.1 billion media powerhouse, officially lives in Orange County but spends most of her time at \"Futureland,\" her family's $15 million, 12,000-square-foot estate overlooking Beverly Hills.</p><p>Meruelo Group founder and Chief Executive Alex Meruelo, who grew up in Los Angeles and made his initial fortune here with La Pizza Loca, is now worth $2 billion, according to the most recent estimates. His company, which spans hospitality, gaming, engineering, construction, food service, banking and media--including L.A. radio and TV stations such as KLOS and KBEH--is based in Downey. But Meruelo and his wife have called Reno, Nev., home since 2011.</p><p>There are numerous reasons why ultrawealthy outsiders don't call Los Angeles home, but taxes are clearly a consideration, especially when places like Florida, Nevada and Texas have no state income tax.</p><p>Identity and image matter, too. Bezos and Amazon, for instance, are inextricably linked with Seattle. (He also owns trophy properties in New York and Washington, D.C.)</p><p>The rise of Zoom and remote work means that, increasingly, where you work doesn't haveto be where you live. Los Angeles remains an appealing destination for part-timers who live somewhere else and full-timers who work somewhere else.</p><p>Luxury buyers</p><p>Despite the pandemic, luxury real estate prices remain strong, and there has been an uptick in sales, according to Hilton &amp; Hyland's David Kramer, who estimates about 20% of his buyers are out-of-towners.</p><p>\"Everyone's working and educating their children at home, so that's caused more of a demand for people to buy new homes with enoughspace,\" said Kramer, who says an unusually high run on Malibu rentals this year has led to quick luxury property purchases by the ultra-wealthy, especially homes that don't need renovations.</p><p>Unlike densely populated urban centers such as New York and San Francisco, Los Angeles in the pandemic era provides sun, space and the ability to socially distance, while still offering the trappings of a big city.</p><p>\"I've already sold, to date, what I sold all of last year, which was my best year,\" Kramer said.</p><p>By TOM SAMILJAN</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LABUJO-636443203</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASAP 636443203</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60XN-5VH1-DYTM-938T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436222</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1284\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Gale Group, Inc.<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 CBJ, L.P.

Good morning, everyone, happy Tuesday to you, I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, August 20th, your top stories right now, just before 6:00 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Breaking news this morning from the retail sector, we are awaiting earnings from Home Depot, out any moment, it could be a market mover. The Dow component touches on retail and could give signs of the state of the Housing market, plus we are keeping a close eye for any impact tariffs could be having as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As soon as those numbers hit the tape, we will get them to you and with full analysis right here, later on this morning, we will hear from retailers Kohl's and T.J. Maxx, big week for the retail sector.</p><p>As we await the report from Home Depot, let's check Futures right now, we're looking at a fractional gain this morning. Dow Futures up just 3 points, S&amp;P Futures up 1-1/2 and the NASDAQ Futures up 9-1/4.</p><p>Extending yesterday's big rally, take a look at the numbers yesterday at the close, President Trump pushing the Federal Reserve for a bigger rate cut, the president asking for 100-basis point cut, once again criticizing Federal Reserve Chairman Jay Powell for what he calls a horrendous lack of vision, says the president. This as the White House pushes back against reports of a payroll tax cut in the works.</p><p>MORNINGS WITH MARIA begins right now.</p><p>And we've got a big show this morning, joining the version this morning, Maxfunds.com co-founder, Jonas Max Ferris is here, Farvahar Partners founder and CEO, Omeed Malik is here, and RealClearPolitics co-founder and president, Tom Bevan, great to see you, guys, this morning.</p><p>OMEED MALIK, FOUNDER AND CEO, FARVAHAR PARTNERS: Good morning.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. We are waiting on Home Depot, we're going to get to those, momentarily. Also, on deck this morning, FOX News senior strategic analyst and retired four-star general, Jack Keane, on Hong Kong this morning.</p><p>Tennessee congressman and House Financial Services Committee member, David Kustoff is here, on the Israeli travel restrictions, along with former White House press secretary America First Action senior adviser, Sean Spicer, on the White House's reported payroll tax cut exploration.</p><p>And then the mayor of El Paso, Texas, Mayor Dee Margo is here to talk immigration. Plus, former pro tennis player, Patrick McEnroe, gives us a preview of the U.S. Open which begins tonight, is the opening -- the opening, actually, party, you don't want to miss a moment of it, so do join us.</p><p>Breaking news, Home Depot is out, let's get to Ashley Webster with the numbers, Ashley.</p><p>ASHLEY WEBSTER FOX BUSINESS NETWORK BUSINESS NEWS JOURNALIST: Yes, good morning to you, Maria, let's get right to it. Earnings per share for Home Depot, coming in at $3.17, that beats the estimate of $3.08, revenue, though, just a touch short, coming in at $30.84 billion, the estimate was for $30.98 billion, just getting into the -- some of the other headlines.</p><p>Same-store sales up three percent, U.S. same-store sales up 3.1 percent. They say lumber prices which, of course, are affected by tariffs, have declined significantly compared to last year, says Home Depot, which impacted their sales growth.</p><p>Diluted earnings per share growth, approximately 3.1 percent from fiscal 2018, sales guidance accounting for that lumber price deflation. So, the cheaper lumber is certainly helping the numbers, but those are the main headlines for you.</p><p>They've had said before, Maria, that the tariffs, if they continue in their current form, could cost them, Home Depot, about a billion dollars each year, so that does take a bite out of their bottom line, but they say that those lumber prices have declined significantly, much of that comes from Canada as we know.</p><p>But, we're miss on the revenue for Home Depot, this stock is up 18 percent since the beginning of the year. Guys, back to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, Ashley, thank you.</p><p>WEBSTER: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Looks like they are lowering their sales guidance, as well, for the full year. Joining us right now to talk more about this, is Strategic Research Group managing director, Burt Flickinger, and Burt, it's good to see you this morning.</p><p>BURT FLICKINGER, MANAGING DIRECTOR, STRATEGIC RESEARCH GROUP: Good to team up, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, thanks so much for joining us, your reaction to the Home Depot numbers?</p><p>FLICKINGER: Home Depot, a little bit softer than we all thought, part of its weather-related, part of its leadership-related too. They're letting - - Maynard is a great privately-held retailer, catch up with them. They're not doing enough to monetize the roofs in terms of using solar power savings to cut prices, add more promotions.</p><p>And what they also need is what you referenced in the beginning, what the president asked Jay Powell to do with the Fed was the 100-basis cut so people can refinance, millennials need more money for cheaper houses and remodel old houses, and the interest rate cuts are really going to be key to drive Home Depot today and the rest of the year.</p><p>And Lowe's for their earnings, tomorrow, as well as the whole housing sector which is still positive, as Ashley reported, positive three percent same-store sales, but not close to the historic rates that your friends, Ken Langone, Bernie Marcus, Arthur Blank, Frank Blake.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, sure. They are also reporting same-store sales which are lower than expected, as well, 3 percent versus 3-1/2 percent. Stock has done, OK, Jonas, your thoughts on Home Depot here, as we look at the retail sector that's obviously facing these tariffs and that's one of the reasons that the company is reporting a miss in revenue.</p><p>JONAS MAX FERRIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, I don't -- I don't think that's a huge factor as much. I want to see what's going to happen with the -- these numbers don't show the new interest rate drop, and actually what matters is what are consumers going to do now that there's all of a sudden, a boom in (INAUDIBLE) again.</p><p>A lot of that money does wind up in cash (INAUDIBLE) people do Home Depot renovations, and new home purchases.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a good point, yes.</p><p>FERRIS: So, that's -- because it's really where it all boils down to, are these low rates because revenue recession, or these low rates going to actually juice consumers to do stuff with borrowed money and it's a little early to know in these numbers. That maybe that forecast seemed a little pessimistic, but that's what I'm watching. What is the U.S. consumer do with the new low rates?</p><p>BARTIROMO: So you're not bothered by this?</p><p>FERRIS: No, the current numbers.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes. Because Burt, we've been waiting to see if the level of mortgage rates would help the housing market, and so far, I guess mortgage rates haven't really dropped as much as all the rates.</p><p>FLICKINGER: They should help, but it's also leadership, so as you and team reported well last week, Wal-mart is doing just about everything right for the consumers, with the suppliers, in terms of pricing.</p><p>The best marketing and merchandising in terms of consumer communication with Arthur Sadoun and his team, Publicis, and power of one. And Home Depot really needs to get back to the basics that the founders and Frank Blake established.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, how do they do that?</p><p>FLICKINGER: They really need to do it in getting away from the same advertising, having the suppliers sponsor a lot of the merchandising programs and spend more time in driving pros. They could do more with the credit cards and they need to do more with in-store merchandising.</p><p>And some of their competitors are catching up to them and in some cases, eclipsing them on home and garden, which are outdoors, especially in the second half of the summer. As Jonas referenced, that's really important going into year-end and an opportunity for them that, historically, they've done better in.</p><p>BARTIROMO: The company is saying we are encouraged by momentum we're seeing from our strategic investments and they're also saying that it expects comp store sales to be up approximately four percent, actually, in the next -- for 2019.</p><p>FLICKINGER: So good, not great.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, good, not great, that's good analysis. Thoughts?</p><p>MALIK: Yes, I'm also fairly same about this, I agree with your points earlier. The interest rates are low, I also noticed that they're saying that they're satisfied with the current health of the U.S. consumer, and that the Housing market remains stable.</p><p>So, with these low rates, people will continue to refinance, take out mortgages, build, we saw Wal-marts last week, they were also pretty good. So, I'm not really concerned about tariffs right now.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And yet, people continue to talk, Tom, about a recession on the horizon, even though you've got pretty strong signs in terms of the consumer and what's going on away from manufacturing.</p><p>TOM BEVAN, CO-FOUNDER AND PRESIDENT, REALCLEARPOLITICS: Right, and that's the key if you look at what President Trump was trying to do, right, talking up the economy and all of his advisers trying to say, hey, what's wrong with a little optimism? It's not as bad as --</p><p>There seems to be this herd mentality in the media that once that talk of recession starts, that's all the media was focused on, but there's still is -- there's still a strength out there, but it is in the consumer, and that's what needs to be kept up, especially President Trump wants to see this economy driven by the consumer. He needs that to continue through his election.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You would think lower rates, rock-bottom rates, coming down, would, in fact, stimulate, but we'll see.</p><p>FLICKINGER: Yes, record amount of student loan debt and the parents and the grandparents are taking it on, so with lower rates, as Jonas and Tom and everyone on the panel referenced, there's a real opportunity for all generations to spend more, especially with home rentals, remodels and buying new homes which will drive the entire economy by another half GDP point.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, if you listen to the Democratic candidates, they are painting a completely different situation in terms of the economy right now.</p><p>MALIK: Yes, they definitely want to -- it almost seems like root for a recession --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALIK: -- which is kind of strange.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bill Barr is actually saying I want a recession. Bring it on.</p><p>MALIK: He actually said that which is very troubling for a variety of reasons. But, on your point, I would also say that household debt, though, is now higher than it was during the financial crisis. So, if we do need to point out anything, it's not so much tariffs, I think it's personal debt, exploding, that to me -- and primarily on the student loan front is a huge issue.</p><p>BARTIROMO: It's a very important point.</p><p>MALIK: Yes, and it's been talked about -- I don't think in the right way at the Democratic level, they are talking about forgiving student debt, I think we should be reforming the tax code that doesn't allow students to charge debt that was passed in 2005.</p><p>FERRIS: Yes, but (INAUDIBLE) positive, I mean, the whole -- we're trying to gauge the U.S. consumers, kind of, holding the whole global economy up at this point, like their desire to borrow is (INAUDIBLE) even though you have long-term, there's probably -- there's too much debt, but like, we want to see them taking out more debt, right now.</p><p>Otherwise, they're being -- they're retracting, and that's bad, so we kind of want to see it grow at this point.</p><p>MALIK: Not all debt is equal, though.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALIK: That's my point.</p><p>FERRIS: Well, auto loan debt is done within student loan debt. I mean, what we're talking (INAUDIBLE) there's a battle of much auto loan debt as student loan, like at least, that's a declining asset that's got no value behind. At least some of the student degrees are sort of valued --</p><p>MALIK: Some.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEVAN: Depends on what --</p><p>MALIK: Where they're studying, yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, we'll watch the stock. So far, fractional moves going up and down, actually, Burt, so we don't really have a read in terms of whether or not this is going to be a big impact on the markets. We got more retail earnings coming out. Burt, we will see you soon.</p><p>FLICKINGER: Yes, maybe too late tomorrow with Lowe's reporting tomorrow and their numbers should be slightly soft too.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Oh, you think Lowe's will be soft, OK. We'll watch that. Burt Flickinger, it's always a pleasure.</p><p>FLICKINGER: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. Coming up, job cuts, United Steel is planning layoffs, hundreds of workers in Michigan are affected. We've got the details after this short break.</p><p>And then the White House versus the Federal Reserve, Fed Chairman Jay Powell facing more criticism from the president, as the president looks for a broader and bigger rate cut, we're taking a look at that when we come back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, a shake-up at the federal prison system following the suicide of accused sex trafficker, Jeffrey Epstein, Cheryl Casone with the details and headlines now, Cheryl.</p><p>CHERYL CASONE, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK ANCHOR: Yes, Maria, Attorney General Bill Barr has named Dr. Kathleen Hawk Sawyer as acting bureau prison's chief. She previously held the position from 1992 to 2003. And we've also learned that Epstein signed a will, two days, before he committed suicide in his jail cell.</p><p>Court documents filed in the U.S. Virgin Islands, show he put his nearly $600 million fortune into a trust, there is no word yet on the beneficiaries.</p><p>Well, U.S. Steel temporarily laying off hundreds of workers in Michigan in the next few weeks, as its Great Lakes Facility -- at its Great Lakes Facility, this move following the company's decision to halt production at that facility.</p><p>Job cuts are expected to be short term, but they could extend past six months. Prices of steel have fallen due to improved supplies and weakening demand. U.S. Steel stock price has slipped 73 percent since March 1st 2018, when President Trump announced his decision to crack down on foreign imports.</p><p>And speaking of the president, he is still pushing for a deal to buy Greenland. The president tweeted out a promise not to build the signature large scale buildings on a massive island. Maria, take a look at this picture. The tweet featured this photo, it's edited, tall gold-colored building blazed into with Trump.</p><p>The president wrote, \"I promise not to do this to Greenland.\" Greenland is Danish territory located between the North Atlantic and the Arctic oceans. No word yet. What price will you pay for Greenland?</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's hilarious.</p><p>CASONE: It's, you know, it's the chatter right now, it's the buzz.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>CASONE: But I like the president's sense of humor on this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: That's very funny, but I think just the fact that he would put the tweet out showed that -- I mean, he's seriously thinking about it.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, yes. Well, he's on his way to Denmark, but for other reasons, so we'll see. You'll never know.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Cheryl, thanks.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Quick break, and then the big tech crackdown, several states attorneys general looking to move forward with their anti-trust investigation on big tech. We have the details.</p><p>Then, a shakeup at the Country Music Awards, Brad Paisley is out as co-host and Carrie Underwood, but she's receiving plenty of star support instead.</p><p>Plus, it's a big week for retail earnings, we are taking a look at Kohl's and TJX later this morning, they will be reporting earnings. We have Home Depot this morning, which was a miss on revenue. Back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, the U.S. economy in focus, the White House official is denying a report that the Trump administration is weighing a temporary payroll tax cut to head off a potential recession. The Washington Post report that the administration is mulling over whether to ask Congress to pass a tax cut. And it comes as President Trump slams Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell, again.</p><p>And he is calling now for a 100-basis point rate cut. This is a significant rate cut that the president is calling for, Tom, and of course, we know that he's been critical of Jay Powell for a long time now.</p><p>BEVAN: He's been more critical of this Fed chairman than any president I can remember. It's been a full-frontal assault on Jay Powell, I mean, he really, in a way that we haven't seen before.</p><p>But as far as the payroll tax cut goes, that would have to be approved by Congress, and there are simply no way that Nancy Pelosi is going to give the president a win, to help boost the economy, heading into this reelection. So, that is a -- that is a dead letter item in terms of getting through Congress.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right, that's -- that is not going to happen. We know that the tax cut plan already did move the needle on economics, but you don't want to keep adding to the debt.</p><p>BEVAN: Trump had --</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>BEVAN: He had one bullet in his gun to fire, he fired it, and he's got to leave with that. And now he's trying to pull whatever leverage he has left at his disposal.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about this idea that he wants a one-point interest rate cut, Jonas, this is pretty aggressive, isn't it? I mean, we just saw the Fed lower rates, and we're obviously in now an easing cycle?</p><p>FERRIS: It is until you look at the rest of the world that it's not that crazy, and there's also this problem where the whole -- this whole inverted yield curve thing is like the one of the primary drivers of the fear that's going on right now, and you could, kind of, make that go away to some extent if you had much lower short-term rates.</p><p>Also, they probably shouldn't have stopped recycling the interest payments coming in on the money they created magically during the last recession, because that also pushed down long-term rates. And then some rates have been better to keep the yield curve positive, even if for no other purpose than engineering confidence in the economy.</p><p>I don't know why they're supposed to operate, but this thing that got everyone scared, just people who (INAUDIBLE) oh, this always happens in a recession, you know, and that's why everyone is worried about a recession now, and that's a dangerous situation.</p><p>Be better to air on the side of inflation, with artificially low rates, that maybe we don't need our economy strong, because you can -- I think we can get out of inflation pretty easily today, because there's $4 trillion of fabricated money that you could just start lighting it on fire and would immediately cause deflation.</p><p>So, we've had that in the 70s, that ability to stop inflation so quickly so we could air on the side of inflation, in my opinion.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, OK. Well, this whole idea of an inverted yield curve, where you've got long-term rates higher than short-term rates, and you're feeling like people are so worried about the short-term that they're piling into the long-term bonds.</p><p>That's the primary worry. That's the primary -- because rates are at -- are at rock-bottom levels. But when you look at other indicators, Omeed, they're pretty good. I mean, the consumer is doing well.</p><p>MALIK: No, I agree, and that's why, as we've spoken about before, I'm not in favor of continuing to just artificially lower rates. I also -- to get advocates responsibility of our federal government and our policymakers if they continue to just pump out cheap money.</p><p>That dollars will continue to expand and the people we sent to Washington will continue to spend our tax dollars (INAUDIBLE) because they think there are no consequences for it. I'm on favor of letting Central Bankers run our policy to what they have been doing for over a decade.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's a good point.</p><p>FERRIS: But is it really artificial -- it seems like it's artificially high, the short-term rates, because the Fed keeps them up, I mean, the part of the rate yield curve, that they don't control, like the 30-year, is at all-time lows now.</p><p>So, and that's not even the one that they're buying into with the -- so it seems like, if the Fed was, sort of, out of the equation, the short-term rates would be in lower, like, they're the ones keeping it above two, it seems like. The market, the amount of money around the world that needs to go into something and save, would actually drive it lower, I think, without the Fed.</p><p>BEVAN: I would add, one of the other pieces of this, which is people are nervous, is the trade policy.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEVAN: It's the trade war and these tariffs, and that is Trump's doing directly.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>BEVAN: But it's create a lot of uncertainty which I think coupled with -- a couple of this other (INAUDIBLE) has people on edge.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I mean, has people on edge, but then, when you look at -- it related just to China, it's hard to know what the alternative is with China, because they keep, you know, reneging on all the things that are the big-ticket items for the U.S.</p><p>I want to talk about two other items this morning, the big tech crackdown. Yesterday, we had tech CEOs in Washington, as many as 20 states are gearing up for an antitrust investigation against Google, Facebook, Amazon and Apple. That's according to the Journal.</p><p>The inquiry expected to start next month, will examine where the big tech users market dominance to kill the competition, your reaction?</p><p>FERRIS: It's worth knowing that it's not just the -- like they're getting in all sides now, and these tech companies. They're already had been super crackdown by foreign governments because those governments don't have this industry to protect. They kind of want just to see the cash machine and to some extent, a more sensitive, than we are, to kind of monopoly in privacy, particularly privacy issues.</p><p>I worry about -- I don't worry about it because I do think they were -- to some extent, a lot of (INAUDIBLE) acquired to many growing competitors and kind of bringing them into their world, where there's really just --</p><p>I know they compete against each other in things like streaming T.V., but when it really boils down to it, when you're buying like add space, they've really inserted themselves into the entire internet, across all social media, which is basically one company in all internet browser stuff, as the other company. And it's hard to get away from it then.</p><p>And it's really -- I can see where it's coming from. It doesn't mean the government's going to go do the job, but it is also where a lot of the earnings growth is that's driving the U.S. economy, the stock markets and if is that the path to where the tech room finally ends. Is it going to be a regulatory path --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>FERRIS: -- on the (INAUDIBLE) maybe. No, I thought it was going to be investors just not wanting to keep losing money in some of these start-ups, but I think it might be that the high-margin era is over.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, the high-margin era may be over, and it's not just, you know, the antitrust issues that are, you know, getting the attention of lawmakers, but it's also the idea that they are censoring conservative conversation, and going into the 2020 election, I think the Congress and the president wants to make sure that they get control of that, so that they have a fair voice in this election.</p><p>MALIK: The marketplace of ideas now is conducted virtually, we used to have Town Square that was physical and we regulated speech that way. Now, it's happening online, and we have all this power centralized and they are clearly discriminating on certain points of view, that raises not just antitrust concerns, but also those of the first amendment and they need to be regulated.</p><p>BARTIROMO: What about the story -- we talked about this yesterday and it's in the top story in the Journal this morning, is the face of capitalism in America. The business round table making a big change, saying that they are -- maximizing profits can no longer be their primary goal.</p><p>The CEO say that the new mission includes taking care of employees and helping communities. The Journal's editorial board writes this morning on this. CEOs aren't popular these days, and it isn't easy to defend profits.</p><p>But sooner or later they will also have to defend the morality of free markets as the greatest source of prosperity for the most people in human history. Platitudes about stakeholders won't stop from President Warren from lining them up. First for the gallons.</p><p>Omeed, you know, this is probably what this is about. You know, when you look at the democratic line-up, business is bad, making money is bad, that's the way these folks see it.</p><p>MALIK: Yes, it's unfortunate at sound in fury, signifying nothing. Basically, I used to be a corporate lawyer, I think about the legal implementation of something that's absurd. So, we usually defer to the business judgment rule in Delaware jurisprudence with corporate law.</p><p>If someone were to be able to sue now, for corporation, didn't appropriately do diversity inclusion or care for the environment, there's really no practical implementation of these types of philosophies that they are espousing -- so, I don't think this really has anything more to do than P.R.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes.</p><p>MALIK: Yes.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I mean, you would imagine -- you would think -- I would've expected that treating employees well in the communities that you operate, and -- was a given.</p><p>MALIK: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You have to actually make that, you know, a priority, I mean, I thought it was a priority.</p><p>BEVAN: But a lot of these CEOs now are faced with pressure from activists, investors --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's true.</p><p>BEVAN: -- and boycotts, I mean, politics now affects everything that we do, and so this is a reaction to that new reality that they're living in, but I agree, I think it's -- as the Wall Street Journal call it preemptive politics, but I don't think it's going to be -- I don't think it's -- the left is not going to call the dogs off here, in terms -- the way they are attacking.</p><p>MALIK: She wants to change the law, so she --</p><p>BARTIROMO: Elizabeth Warren?</p><p>MALIK: Warren actually is suggesting that we change the way corporations are incorporated, so it would be federally incorporated and have to abide by some of these stipulations as opposed going to Delaware or other states to incorporate.</p><p>MALIK: I wonder what that would do for innovation and productivity.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and she wants to take a knife to private equity, to the major banks, so they are saying this, and saying oh God, you know, is this going to be the new normal for us. We've got to get in front of it.</p><p>MALIK: Right.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We'll take a short break. When we come back, the unrest in Hong Kong continues this morning. A member of the U.K. consulate detained in China, as Twitter and Facebook crackdown on protests misinformation. We're going to bring you that story when we come back.</p><p>And then speaking out, Dale Earnhardt Jr. breaking his silence days after he and his family survived a fiery plane crash, all that right after this.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Good Tuesday morning, everybody. Thanks so much for joining us. I'm Maria Bartiromo, and it is Tuesday, August 20th. Your top stories right now. 6:31 a.m. on the East Coast.</p><p>Retail is in focus this morning. The Home Depot just reporting earnings cutting its sales guidance for the year to account for low lumber prices and the effect of potential tariffs.</p><p>However, the company is saying that the current health of the U.S. consumer and the stable housing environment continues to support the business. Stock is up a quarter of a percent. It is pretty much back and forth flat on these numbers.</p><p>Later this morning, we will hear from Kohl's and TJX. We will have those numbers and full analysis as we continue to zero in on the consumer in its economy.</p><p>Markets this morning are looking to extend yesterday's big rally. The Dow Futures right now at 18 points, the S&amp;P Futures are up 3-1/4, and the Nasdaq Futures higher by 13 points.</p><p>The SEPTA stocks kicked off the week with a rally, pushed by hopes of central bank's stimulus and a trade deal. Dow Industrials yesterday we're up 250 points, almost one percent. S&amp;P was up 35 points and the Nasdaq was up 106. That was 1-1/3 percent.</p><p>Global markets this morning look like this in terms of the European indices as a firmer tone there as well. FT-100 up 36 points, one-half of one percent. CAC Quarante in Paris is up 12, and the DAX Index in Germany, up just three points this morning.</p><p>In Asia overnight, it was mixed. Take a look at the numbers as you see, the Shanghai Composite was down a fraction as was Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index.</p><p>This morning, China once again looking to boost its economy. Setting its new lone prime rate at 4-1/4 percent. That is lower than the existing benchmark, one-year lending rate. So, more stimulus in the Chinese economy as the economy weakens there.</p><p>The world is watching Hong Kong. A British official in Hong Kong reportedly has been detained by Chinese authorities during the visit to mainland China.</p><p>Meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence urging China to respect Hong Kong's laws. He's warning an active violence could jeopardize any trade deal with the United States.</p><p>And he's breaking his silence this morning Dale Earnhardt Jr., speaking out after last week's plane crash. What he said after that fiery plane crash, coming up. Whistleblower focuses on Disney.</p><p>Details on the accusations that the entertainment giant inflated revenue for years. Stock is down this morning on Disney.</p><p>Plus, Brad Paisley is out of a job. He is being replaced as co-host of the CMA Award. We'll tell you who's joining Carrie Underwood on the stage for the Country Music Awards. All those stories coming up this Tuesday morning.</p><p>But first, our top story this half an hour. The unrest in Hong Kong. Look at these pictures. An employee actually this was 1.7 million people who came out on Sunday even in. A Hong Kong protesters were out in force on Sunday.</p><p>An employee of the U.K. consulate, meanwhile, in Hong Kong, reportedly has been detained in mainland China, amid made ongoing protests. Vice president Mike Pence weighed in on the situation yesterday.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>MIKE PENCE, VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: To the United States to make a deal with China, Beijing needs to honor its commitments beginning with the commitment China made in 1984 to respect the integrity of Hong Kong's laws. It'll be much harder for us to make a deal, there something violent happens in Hong Kong.</p><p>And I want to assure you, our administration will continue to urge Beijing to act in a humanitarian manner, and to urged China and the demonstrators in Hong Kong to resolve their differences peaceably.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BARTIROMO: Meanwhile, Twitter and Facebook are now working to suspend accounts that are spreading misinformation about the protest. The speculation to dismiss information is coming from China about the Hong Kong protests. So, the social media companies are taking them down.</p><p>Joining me right now is retired four-star general, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst General Jack Keane. General, it's always a pleasure to see you.</p><p>GEN. JACK KEANE (RET.), FOX NEWS SENIOR STRATEGIC ANALYST: Great seeing you, Maria.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much for joining us. First, give me a reaction what's going on in Hong Kong, with serious protesters going on.</p><p>KEANE: Oh, yes. It's unprecedented to see a protest like that. Almost 2 million people in the pouring rain.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Big percentage of the overall population.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, staggering. If we were doing that in the United States, it would be an excess of 87 million people based on a proportion of population.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Exactly.</p><p>KEANE: To give you a sense of how serious this really is. And it's a peaceful protest. This is a major problem for China in coping with this problem. And they've been literally -- and you -- you've exposed this so well on your show here and bringing the billionaire protester, Jimmy Lai on here, to talk about what's actually happening. But for 10 years, China has been gradually taking away their personal freedoms and liberty. And that's what this is really all about.</p><p>BARTIROMO: You know, this is interesting because, for a long time, I always saw Hong Kong as this major international financial hub. The way I see London, the way I see New York, I don't see it that way anymore for some reason.</p><p>I -- maybe it's because of that. Because little by little, they have been taking away their personal freedoms.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, I think the financial aspect of it is still pretty solid. But it is at risk, particularly if China chooses to clamp down on this and use violence. I think that will absolutely destroy that financial hub in Asia.</p><p>BARTIROMO: And this is about broken promises. I mean, this is also goes back to the president trying to do a trade deal with China.</p><p>If they broke promises with the WTO, they broke promises with Hong Kong, they broke promises with the U.S. in terms of buying beef or whatever promises they've made in the past, how would we trust them to keep to their word in terms of this trade deal?</p><p>KEANE: Yes, absolutely. I really applaud the administration. The president himself has said it. Now Vice-President Pence has said it as well. They're tying a deal with China over trade, intellectual property. To how the protesters are treated in Hong Kong, and that's --</p><p>BARTIROMO: That was very significant.</p><p>KEANE: That is very significant. I think one more step if they would say, there would be consequences if you choose violence, and do not respect the peaceful protest. And the United States will lead the world in sanctioning you for it.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Which is why we're questioning why an employee of the U.K. consulate in Hong Kong is being detained in mainland China this morning?</p><p>KEANE: Yes, and in their minds, he's done something to undermine the regime. And who knows where the truth of all of that is?</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's scary.</p><p>KEANE: And we know full well that there are people that have been arrested. And that's why -- that the protest is one of the reasons why the protesters are in the street. There have been people in Hong Kong who have been taken to mainland China and now in jail without any due process, whatsoever.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and then, there's the extradition bill, obviously. That's what China wants. I think it's important to note who's in the streets? They're young people. They are afraid for their futures. They are afraid that China is going to clamp down, and they're going to have to change all their values that they grow up with.</p><p>And then, there's Taiwan. Beijing is threatening consequences after President Trump approved the $8 billion sale of fighter jets to Taiwan. This coming amid reports that the U.S. military in Asia could be overwhelmed by Chinese forces in just hours. Your reaction.</p><p>KEANE: Well, first of all, I think that the deal was absolutely essential. Since 1979, when China was recognized mainland China, the United States has had a deal with Taiwan to provide material for their defense, and to support their defense, and to come to their defense in the event of Communist Chinese party invasion of Taiwan.</p><p>So, this deal is another step in that direction. We've done this before. It's been a while since we made a deal of this consequence. And this administration, I think, is doing absolutely the right thing.</p><p>The best deterrence for China not invading Taiwan is for Taiwan itself to be able to impose cost on that invasion. Delay the outcome of it, so the United States can come to their assistance in a tangible way.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, and this is probably something that's upsetting China and Xi Jinping that the president is going ahead with this. Recognizing Taiwan, recognizing the deal that was in place.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, while the United States is doing what? The United States is honoring their commitment here.</p><p>BARTIROMO: But, exactly.</p><p>KEANE: And that's an important thing. And I think the more pressure on President Xi from the United States in trade, geopolitical pressure, assistance to Taiwan, standing up for the protesters, all of that helps them in this negotiations in my view.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, I'm sure. Peace in Afghanistan. Let me -- let me turn to Afghanistan now. Had Lindsey Graham on Sunday. He does not want -- you know, a troop drawdown in Afghanistan. The U.S. reportedly nearing a peace agreement with the Taliban in Afghanistan. It could bring the remaining 14,000 troops there home to the United States. Your reaction.</p><p>KEANE: Well, listen, the Taliban withdrawal driven are very hard bargain with the United States because when negotiations began, the Taliban knew full well that the United States was predisposed getting out of Afghanistan.</p><p>As a result of that, they put on the table as a -- as end state that you must announce to complete withdrawal for the United States. So, I think that's coming, if the president goes along with the proposal, I hope he does not.</p><p>And that proposal will say that the United States would likely withdraw our all troops by the end of 2020. And as a result of that, there is a couple of conditions. One, the Taliban will negotiate with the Afghan government. That's a good thing.</p><p>Two, and listen to this closely, the Taliban will guaranty that the al- Qaeda will not reconstitute a safe haven in Afghanistan which is a reason why we're there, in the first place, because that's from where the attack on 9/11 came, and they will also destroy ISIS.</p><p>What's wrong with that? One is we are trusting the Taliban.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Well, right. I was going to say, should we believe them?</p><p>KEANE: Does anybody believe that the al-Qaeda is not talking to the -- that the Taliban is not talking to the al-Qaeda right now, and saying to them, lie low. The Americans are going to get out by the end of 2020. Don't increase your fighters, don't increase any of your activity. When they walk out the door, you can come back here and do what you want to do.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Do you think the president is going to listen to the sentiment that they are doing it?</p><p>KEANE: I hope the president is going through a consideration of what to do. And I just hope he is listening.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, very similar comments that you make as Senator Lindsey Graham on Sunday. General, it's great to see you.</p><p>KEANE: Yes, great talking to you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Thank you so much. General Jack Keane, there.</p><p>Meanwhile, Dale Earnhardt Jr. breaking his silence, days after he and his family survived a fiery plane crash.</p><p>Cheryl Casone with the headlines, now. Cheryl.</p><p>CASONE: Yes, Maria. Dale Earnhardt Jr. released a statement on Twitter. And he thanked supporters, and he also said his family is truly blessed that all on board escaped that crash with no serious injuries.</p><p>The private jet rolled off runway in east Tennessee and caught fire after landing last week. Earnhardt and his family spent a few hours at a hospital before being released.</p><p>Earnhardt's wife sharing the sweet photo saying, \"God is good.\" That, of course, is their baby in that picture.</p><p>General Electric is now firing back against accusations by Harry Markopolos. The company has told investors that the current reserves for its long-term care insurance business are well funded.</p><p>G.E. also defended the accounting for its oil and gas business. Last Thursday, Markopolos accused G.E. of filing inaccurate or fraudulent regulation with regulators, sending the shares down about 11 percent.</p><p>G.E. chief executive Larry Culp, said the allegations from the Bernie Madoff whistleblower are mounted to market manipulation. Stay tuned on that one.</p><p>And then, there is this. Another whistleblower claiming that Disney inflated revenue for years. Sandra Kuba, a former accountant at Disney, says the company over sent an annual revenue by as much as $6 billion.</p><p>Kuba filed a number of complaints with the SEC. Disney who fired Kuba back in 2017, said it looked into her claims and found them to be, \"utterly baseless\".</p><p>And Maria, I love this one. Recall that ladies night at the Country Music Awards is so fun, right? Carrie Underwood teaming up with Reba McEntire and -- oh my gosh, Dolly Parton. The host country's biggest night.</p><p>The powerhouse lad that means that Brad Paisley has been hosting the show with Underwood since 2008, out of a gig, but it seemed OK, with the switchers when he tweeted.</p><p>As a fan of all three of these amazing women, I can't wait to watch. The CMA broadcast November 13th, nominees announced, Maria, next week. Dolly Parton, she is back.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, it's good news. I will watch it though, and Cheryl, thank you so much.</p><p>CASONE: You bet.</p><p>BARTIROMO: I will be right back. Stay with us.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back. Headline as cross America this morning. The San Francisco Chronicle reports: \"Bay Area cities are poised to follow Berkeley's natural gas ban.\" Now, with Berkeley leading the way as the first U.S. city to ban national gas lines in new residential buildings, San Jose, Santa Rosa and Petaluma are ready to follow in order to meet climate goals, heating and appliances like dryers and ranges would have to run on electricity.</p><p>The Chicago Tribune this morning writes: \"Uber confirms it's moving to massive space in the old post office.\" And amass of amount of space for thousands of employees, Uber is ready to move into Chicago's old post office, signing a 10-year lease. The company says it will be the building's largest tenants, occupying 463,000 square feet.</p><p>The South Florida Sun Sentinel this morning reports: \"Beat and tweet, Florida has the most complaining drivers on Twitter, study says.\" Autowise.com ranking Florida the \"official home of the horrible driver.\" The site geotags Twitter data from last month and had researchers figure out what states had most mentions and complaints about bad driving. About 10,000 tweets were tracked: Virginia, Tennessee, Wisconsin and Maine rounded up top five. Is that true, Jonas?</p><p>JONAS FERRIS, FOX BUSINESS NETWORK CONTRIBUTOR: It's not a qualitative analysis. If you get quotes for a car insurance across the country, you will find it. Especially Miami-Dade is about double of New York City in many occasions, there's a reason for that.</p><p>BARTIROMO: There you go.</p><p>FERRIS: (INAUDIBLE) shaken you down, that's what the settlements are.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Bottom line.</p><p>FERRIS: Between the results during the driving, that's the problem.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Yes, that's not good. Coming up, anti-trust crack-down, states reportedly ready to move forward with big-tech investigation. Plus, whiskey business; how tariffs are affecting profits there. We are talking to one distiller up next back in a minute.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Welcome back, the U.S. whiskey industry struggling to make up for loss business. According to Distilled (INAUDIBLE) Council, 63 percent of American whiskey exports to face tariffs from Europe, China and others. Joining us right now is the Founder and Master Distiller of Dad's Hat Pennsylvania Rye Whiskey Company, Herman Mihalich. Herman, good to see you, thank you so much for being here this morning.</p><p>HERMAN MIHALICH, FOUNDER, DAD'S HAT PENNSYLVANIA RYE WHISKEY COMPANY: Good morning, thanks for inviting me.</p><p>BARTIROMO: So, tell us about the impact tariffs have had on your business?</p><p>MIHALICH: Well, in 2014, we were approached by importer in Europe, La Maison du Whiskey, to start exporting our products to Europe sow some nice growth, there's an umbrella created by the high scotch prices and there's also demand created by the trend of -- specialty cocktails growing in Europe as it's grown in the United States. So, we saw some nice growth in 2014 to 2017 and first and second quarter of last year, our sales dried up entirely and after talking with our importer, it was a clear loss of enthusiasm on their part to try to support pushing through that 25 percent tariff increase and we've really just lost complete sales there since second quarter of last year.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Wow, and that sounds like it's solid because of the tariffs?</p><p>MIHALICH: It really has been a widespread across other distillers as well and it just, you know, we had a window there where we were growing quite nicely and they were very enthusiastic about supporting our business, and unfortunately, that really -- you know, from a psychological point of view as well as reality on the ground of the 25 percent increase, just made it more difficult for us to get the enthusiasm we need to -- we need on the ground with our distributors in Europe.</p><p>MALIK: Hi, Herman, this is Omeed. I'm curious, one of the things President Trump is talking about outside of the tariffs with the European Union is he's trying to strike a bilateral trade deal with the United Kingdom. If that deal does go into place, will that help mitigate some your current struggles?</p><p>MIHALICH: Well, that's all going to depend on Brexit, right now everybody is in standstill in the U.K., you can't talk to anybody about anything, they are all sitting around waiting to see what happens. So, it's hard for me to say. Until we see what happens with Brexit, it's really a wild card.</p><p>FERRIS: Herman, how much of this -- as you said, they're still drinking -- it's still trendy to drink (INAUDIBLE) in Europe as it is here with the (INAUDIBLE) culture. How much was your tariffs and -- I believe Japanese whiskey tariffs went down recently, with deals with the E.U. where they go no tariffs now. So, what if there's dropdown? It's like what's the net tariff difference between you and the competition in Japan?</p><p>MIHALICH: That's a good question. I don't know the answer to that question, unfortunately. We don't see Japanese whiskey as district competitor necessarily because that's more of a sipping whiskey and a different culture. The target we were going after, really, was the American whiskey culture with cocktails and classic cocktails and pre- prohibition speak-easy-style cocktails.</p><p>BEVAN: Herman, this is Tom Bevan, you were also hit by tariffs in Canada and Mexico and I wonder, would a renegotiating USMCA be helpful to your business as well?</p><p>MIHALICH: Well, the changes in Canada has already sparked some interest where we had lost business in Canada as well, we've just started negotiations with an importer there to reenter the Canadian market. We've never been active in Asia; we've only been focusing on Europe for the time being. We're a fairly small company and it's difficult to spread ourselves to thinly across different markets.</p><p>BARTIROMO: All right. We will leave it there. Herman, we'll be watching. Thanks so much for joining us this morning.</p><p>MIHALICH: Thank you.</p><p>BARTIROMO: Herman Mihalich there. Still ahead, retails in focus this morning. As we told you earlier, Home Depot lowering its full-year guidance for sales. Kohl's is set to report moments from now. We'll have all those numbers as soon as they are out, next up. And then, chicken wars; feathers fighting online. The fight over who has the best chicken sandwich heats up, next hour on MORNINGS WITH MARIA.

Streaming video on demand (SVOD) and streaming music were the two largest categories, with 16 million and 12 million subscriptions respectively.</p><p>More than half those watching video services believed they had become essential during the pandemic. Telsyte says the total number of subscriptions reached around 16.3 million at the end of June, a year-on-year increase of 32 per cent from 12.3 million in June 2019.</p><p>Netflix (5.4 million) and Stan (2.1 million) remained the top two SVOD service providers at the end of June. Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ (launched in Nov 2019) both emerged strongly with 1.7 and 1.1 million subscriptions, respectively.</p><p>Telsyte estimates that the total sports SVOD category grew by 11 per cent year on year to 4.9 million subscriptions at the end of June. Telstra Sports Live Passes, Optus Sport and Kayo Sports made up around 95 per cent of total sports SVOD subscriptions.</p><p>\"Despite a hiccup during the shutdown period, sports video subscriptions are set to continue to grow strongly as fans turn to apps instead of attending stadiums,\" says Telsyte managing director, Foad Fadaghi.            </p><p>The problem of diminished fresh content is likely to surface in the second half, with research showing consumers are recognising new program additions are in decline.</p><p>Broadcasting Video on Demand services (BVOD), including 9Now and ABC iView have benefited as Australians searched for more content during the lockdown, while the pay TV market (which includes residential cable, satellite and IPTV) is down 6 per cent year-on-year to 2.6 million subscriptions at the end of June.</p><p> Telsyte says about half of Australian households have a gaming console and five million people regularly purchase games (downloads and physical) making it a vibrant part of the entertainment market.            </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">9.40am: </emphasis>               The pace quickens in Huawei extradition case            </p><p>               Evidence used by the US to justify the extradition of Huawei Technologies chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou is \"unreliable and defective\" and should not be considered by a Canadian court, Meng's lawyers argued in documents released to the media.            </p><p/><p>Meng, 48, was arrested in December 2018 on a warrant from the US which alleges that she misled the bank HSBC about Huawei's business dealings in Iran. She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition while on house arrest in Vancouver.</p><p>Meng's lawyers submitted testimony from expert witnesses including John Bellinger, a former White House lawyer, as well as a Huawei Technologies presentation outlining its relationship with businesses operating in Iran, to back Huawei's argument that the US left out key facts about communication with HSBC about Huawei's operations in Iran when requesting Meng's extradition from Canada.</p><p>The submissions show that the evidence used by the US as part of its case is \"manifestly unreliable - so unreliable and defective - to justify refusing to commit (Meng) for extradition,\" lawyers for Huawei wrote.</p><p>The issue is scheduled to be argued in a British Columbia courtroom in September as part of Meng's extradition hearing. The entire extradition hearing is expected to run till April 2021.</p><p>On Monday, Meng will attend hearings in a Canadian courtroom via telephone, arguing for the Canadian attorney general to release more confidential documents relating to her arrest to show that her rights were abused. The Canadian attorney general has held back some of the documents related to her arrest claiming privilege.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Reuters</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">9.20am:

businesses would not have to pay Apple's cut for a new paid online events product the world's biggest social media company is launching on its core platform.</p><p>Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p><p>On Thursday, Apple removed popular video game \"Fortnite\" from its app store for violating its in-app payment guidelines, sparking a backlash online and prompting developer Epic Games to file a federal antitrust lawsuit challenging Apple's rules.</p><p>Apple takes a cut of between 15pc and 30pc for most app subscriptions and payments made inside apps, though there are some exceptions for companies that already have a credit card on file for iPhone customers if they also offer an in-app payment that would benefit Apple.</p><p><emphasis

But what is Canada's advantage for the 2020s?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We're not going to undercut the global heavyweights on taxes or labour costs. To win this race, we have to place strategic bets on a few important horses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fortunately, we're already running ahead in a lane with critical global significance: clean tech. I don't know of any other country doing a volume of smarter, more innovative work in this space.</p><p>But if Canadian innovators have the tech, why aren't they already leading this race? Why are commercialization and scale such chronic problems for our startups?</p><p>Here's one big reason: Their home market isn't adopting enough of their transformative solutions. The problem isn't supply, it's demand. Demand from consumers in some cases, but also demand from Canadian business leaders, who have the capital but simply aren't as supportive of homegrown technology solutions as they are in other countries.</p><p>For years, economists, analysts and journalists fretted over Canada's competitiveness problem. They cite the same old causes (history, culture) and offer the same old policy solutions (lower taxes, less regulation). But the issue persists.</p><p>While taxes and regulatory policies are important, they're too often an excuse to drive dividends and stock buybacks and line investors' pockets.</p><p>For greater effect, they should be designed to incentivize adoption of transformative technologies - especially technologies that Canada can leverage to compete on the global stage. Like clean tech.</p><p>We often talk about commercialization like it's a nut for startups to crack before profiting. But lack of adoption also hurts the big companies, because they're missing out on competitive advantage. This isn't charity - it's fiduciary duty.</p><p>Our competitors understand what's at stake. Look at how Germany, South Korea and the United States support their homegrown companies. Look at China, which is speed-running the adoption race at giant scale. Alibaba has 550 million shoppers. Didi, which bought out Uber's China operation, has 20 million drivers in 400 cities. That's what \"all in\" innovation adoption looks like.</p><p>Back to clean tech. One important lane for Canada is energy storage. Our country sells surplus energy too cheaply and buys peak energy too dearly. Our inability to use renewables efficiently has kept us pumping out carbon too long. We need energy storage solutions.</p><p>Fortunately, we have companies like Hydrostor, which pumps compressed air into underwater balloons at off-peak times, then releases it to run generators when the grid needs power. They did a much-publicized pilot off the Toronto Islands, but had to go to Australia to see the technology adopted at scale. That project in a flooded mine will seek electricity directly into Australia's national grid.</p><p>Here in Canada, it took fellow innovation NRSTOR to partner with them to launch a commercial scale rollout in Goderich, Ont.</p><p>And China? It's in the middle of a five-year plan to invest almost $500 billion in renewables. Are we waiting for the next wave of commercially viable energy storage companies to happen there? That could work out. Or we could get another Huawei. Why not buy the solutions being developed at home?</p><p>The big tech story of 2019 was venture capital froth. But the investments that really matter to most companies are when people and businesses buy their products.</p><p>In the decade ahead, Canadian businesses need to keep their eye on the products emerging in their own back yard.

Carnival Cruise Lines says it plans to gradually resume cruising in North America in August, nearly five months after it halted operations due to the new coronavirus. Sailings will begin on Aug. 1 with eight ships setting off from Galveston, Texas; Miami; and Port Canaveral, Florida. </p><p>(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara, File)The outbreak of the coronavirus has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are developments Thursday related to the national and global response, the work place and the spread of the virus. ________________________ TRAVEL &amp;#38; LEISURE:  \u2014 Hong KongDisneyland officially reopened on Thursday after a major drop in coronavirus cases in the Chinese territory. Advance reservations will be required and only limited attendance will be allowed at the park, one of the pillars of Hong Kong's crucial tourism industry.  Social distancing measures are being implemented in lines, at restaurants, on rides and at shops, while cleaning and disinfecting will be increased. Visitors will have their temperatures checked at the entrance and will be required to wear masks at all times inside the park, except when eating and drinking. Disney is planning to reopen its parks in California and Florida next month.  \u2014 Delta Air Lines says more than 40,000 of its 91,000 employees have agreed to take unpaid leave of up to a year, which along with a 'moderate' increase in ticket sales is helping the airline cut its cash burn rate to $30 million a day by the end of this month. That is $10 million a day less than Delta forecast a week ago.  Delta has raised more than $14 billion in financing and expects to have $10 billion in available funds by year end. U.S. airlines face layoffs when federal payroll aid runs out in October unless air travel rebounds. \u2014 Carnival's revenue nosedived in the second quarter as it was unable to sail any cruises. The company hasn't sailed any cruises since mid-March. For the quarter, the cruise operator reported an adjusted loss of $2.38 billion on revenue of $700 million. A year earlier it had an adjusted profit of $457 million on revenue of $4.8 billion. (Ad) The next big tech trend that could explode in today's new economy is coming to your hometown - which could make you a small fortune over the next few years.Carnival anticipates a phased resumption of its cruises, but doesn't have a specific start date. The company expects that initial sailings will be from a select number of easily accessible homeports.  Carnival says it's seeing growing demand for new bookings for next year. For the six weeks ended May 31, approximately two-thirds of 2021 bookings were new bookings. The remaining 2021 booking volumes was from guests applying future cruise credits to specific cruises. CONSUMER SPENDING: Consumers are increasingly moving away from cash and opting for contact-free and digital payment experiences, according to a study by Mastercard. Globally, almost seven in 10 consumers say the shift to digital payments will likely be permanent, and nearly half of consumers plan to use cash less, even after the pandemic subsides, according to a Mastercard weekly survey launched April 27. Online spending in the U.S. grew by 93% year-over-year in May, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which measures retail sales across all payment types including cash and check. AUTOMOBILES: Car production in the Czech Republic fell by 52.9% in May from a year ago, with new car registration down 44.4%. The Czech Automotive Industry Association says production began to somewhat recover in May following an 88.5% decline in April, but it remains under pressure due to a lack of demand. Overall, a total of 399,681 cars were made in the country in the first five months of the year, down by 35.7% compared with the same period last year. The Czech economy relies heavily on the car industry. Germany's Volkswagen, South Korea's Hyundai and Japan-France's Toytota/PSA all have major plants in the country. CENTRAL GOVERNMENTS &amp;#38; BANKS: \u2014 Greece's government has announced a new system of fines and penalties for businesses that are found to be violating regulations imposed to limit the spread of the coronavirus. Under details published Thursday in the government gazette, fines for violations will range from 1,000 euros to 50,000 euros ($1,125 to $56,240). For bars and restaurants, offending businesses will be shut down for 15 days for the first violation, 30 days for the second violation and 60 days for the third if all three violations occur within three months. Other retail businesses face similar penalties, with the amount of the fines varying in accordance to whether the violation is the first, and according to the size of the business. Regulations include limits on the number of people allowed into a business depending on its physical size, distances to be maintained between tables at cafes, bars, restaurants and outdoor movie theaters, and mandatory masks to be work by staff handling fresh food. \u2014 The Spanish government has announced an economic assistance plan of more than 4.2 billion euros ($4.7 billion) for the nation's tourism industry. Tourism generates 12% of Spain's GDP and provides 2.6 million jobs. It is especially important on Spain's Balearic and Canary Islands. The aid package is aimed to help the tourism industry improve its health standards to make travel safer in times of a pandemic and offer direct lines of credit to failing companies, among other measures. Juan Cierco, head of tourism for Spain's Chamber of Commerce, said Thursday that Spain's tourism sector was in a 'critical' situation and set to lose 84 billion euros ($94 billion) this year. The government announced a separate aid package for its auto industry earlier this week.20 Stocks Wall Street Analysts Love the Most[1]Every trading day, between 500 and 800 new recommendations and research reports are issued by sell-side equities research analysts.

As you already know, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing</emphasis> walked away from a \u00a332bn bid for the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">London Stock Exchange Group</emphasis> on Tuesday. </p><p>DD has spent the past 24 hours asking that question and we remain none the wiser. </p><p>HKEX\u2019s abandoned bid effort, for which we have delved into in this feature today, can serve a useful purpose for DD readers in how not to pursue a hostile deal. </p><p>Here are a few lessons learned that everyone, including HKEX\u2019s advisers, led by boutique bank <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Moelis &amp; Company</emphasis>, can take away for next time: </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Timing: If <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Charles Li</emphasis>, the chief executive of HKEX is to be believed, his company has been eyeing a bid for the LSE Group for the past year. For whatever reason the company never made an approach until the LSE engineered its own megadeal. Over the past year, LSE\u2019s share price climbed rapidly and gave it a strong enough acquisition currency to pursue a deal it had been eyeing for sometime: the $27bn purchase of data provider <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Refinitiv</emphasis>. After DD broke news of that deal, LSE shares continued to climb higher and higher, a strong vote of confidence on its dealmaking decision. HKEX has defended its move saying it was now or never given the Refinitiv transaction, which it didn\u2019t support. Bolder leadership would have acted sooner if the LSE deal was a must have. </p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Seduction: It takes two to tango in love and M&amp;A. So perhaps it wasn\u2019t the wisest move to meet with LSE officials, who are busy working on their own deal, to drop the news that you\u2019re going to bid for them. And before the LSE had time to produce a formal response, HKEX released the offer to the entire world, with Li going so far as calling it \u201ca corporate Romeo and Juliet story\u201d. (Facepalm). Sure, the bid valued the LSE at a premium to where it was trading, even considering the gains from the Refinitiv news. But the HKEX bid was mostly paper, which is something completely different to cash on the table. For a hostile deal like this, cash is king. The LSE responded with cutting language, scorching any possibility of future engagement and sending HKEX on a futile multi-week journey to win over shareholders. Our reporting suggests they made only limited progress on that front.</p></bodyText></listItem></list><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>Politics: Perhaps HKEX was comforted by its previous record of UK dealmaking. Back in 2012, it was able to successfully complete a takeover of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">London Metal Exchange</emphasis>, which itself was sensitive albeit smaller. But has anyone at HKEX picked up a newspaper lately? Suffice it to say things have changed between the West and China over the past few years. Did the HKEX think that an acquisition of a systemically important asset, with a reasonable US presence, was ever going to fly in the current political or regulatory environment in either the UK or US?</p></bodyText></listItem></list><p>HKEX made no compelling arguments to address the above points, which leaves us with a bunch of hard-to-answer questions: </p><p>Were HKEX executives just trying to get a break from the uprising in Hong Kong by making a bid that required ample time overseas? </p><p>Was HKEX trying an <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">HSBC</emphasis>-type move to use a deal to secure a UK-headquarters over time and de-risk its governance from its home market? </p><p>Was HKEX given the greenlight by Beijing to take a run at a deeply strategic piece of market infrastructure at a crucial moment of geopolitical tensions and hope to navigate the politics with the UK and the US over the next few months?</p><p>Here is Li\u2019s explanation in a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.hkexgroup.com/Media-Centre/Special/Disclaimer/RcFs8fo_s4Gj2_f1211FTjp55w_3DF2ww35ed/Chief-Executive-Blog/Through-the-Looking-Glass?sc_lang=en\"> blog post</url> from Tuesday aptly titled <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Through the Looking Glass</emphasis>. </p><p>Drop us a line if you have the answers to these questions or to share your thoughts:  and go deeper with our feature on the topic here and the Lex column here. </p><p>How do you solve a problem like Huawei? </p><p>The Trump administration has been unequivocal about just how dangerous Chinese telecoms group <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Huawei </emphasis>is to the US and its friends in the West. </p><p>It has been trying for months now to convince allies to agree to ban Huawei from their 5G networks, warning them that the Chinese company poses a threat to their security because its telecoms equipment could be used by Beijing for spying.</p><p>The only problem is that there\u2019s no American rival to Huawei, which sells about 28 per cent of the world\u2019s telecoms equipment. Its dominance in the industry makes it a vital asset to anyone wanting to implement 5G technology. </p><p>The Trump administration has hit upon a novel idea: What about funneling money to Huawei\u2019s European rivals instead so that they can offer potential customers the same generous financing terms currently on offer from the Chinese company. DD thinks the likes of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nokia </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ericsson </emphasis>would be happy to do deals in the US. </p><p>Or the US could try to foster a homegrown rival by getting American telecoms equipment companies such as <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oracle </emphasis>and <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cisco </emphasis>to consider entering the radio transmission market, although they\u2019re apparently not so keen on the prospect. Maybe throw in an incentive or two? </p><p>These are just a few of the suggestions floating around Washington, which also include potential tax breaks for American start-ups developing the next generation of telecoms technology. </p><p>But given how worried Trump officials are about this problem, any western company competing with Huawei might expect favourable treatment from the US over a range of regulatory issues \u2014 including any potential M&amp;A activity. Happy hunting. </p><p>Hitachi: a lesson on Japanese corporate governance</p><p>Sometimes talking about your failures can be just as important as celebrating your successes. </p><p>Japanese conglomerate <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hitachi </emphasis>isn't afraid of looking back at its brutal financial losses during the crisis. The staggering $8bn loss Hitachi suffered in 2008 marked the start of a new era for the company, which has spent the past decade unravelling its complicated corporate structure that is synonymous with many of its Japanese peers.</p><p>To many observers, Hitachi was a prime example of why Japan so badly needed a governance overhaul. It had tons of subsidiaries that owned everything from rice cookers to nuclear power plants and few independent board members. </p><p>Hitachi was operating under an old-school Japanese mentality that many of the country\u2019s corporates are struggling to shift, even as activist investors flood into Japan\u2019s stock market. Change is afoot, with the government taking an active role in laying down a governance code, but progress has been slow. </p><p>For companies still resisting the winds of change, Hitachi teaches an important lesson: Happy shareholders will reward the company. </p><p>Hitachi shares have more than doubled since the start of 2009, while the benchmark <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Topix </emphasis>index has climbed just over 80 per cent. The company is leaner after a clear out of its subsidiaries and there\u2019s a clear focus on its IT and infrastructure businesses. </p><p>Read the full story from the FT\u2019s Leo Lewis. </p><p>Job moves </p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nissan</emphasis> has picked <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Makoto Uchida</emphasis>, the head of its China operations, as the company\u2019s new chief executive.

Over the same period, Nasdaq welcomed 57 new biotech firms, raising a combined $5.97 bn - half the global market.</p><p>The Hong Kong reforms have attracted some big tech names: smartphone giant Xiaomi raised $5.43 bn in July when it became the first dual-class shareholding company to list, while online food delivery service Meituan-Dianping raised $4.2 bn in its massive IPO last September.</p><p>Hong Kong also had six out of the top 10 biotech IPOs worldwide last year, including the top two: Shanghai medical tech platform WuXi AppTec, which raised $1.06 bn, and cancer drug developer BeiGene, which raised $902 mn.</p><p>The bad news is that most of the newly listed companies have seen their share price fall since their IPO as the stock market took something of a hit from the US-China trade war and a slowing Chinese economy. Meituan-Dianping, for example, is down 20 percent from its debut price, while Ascletis Pharma, which raised $400 mn in its IPO, has fallen by more than half.</p><p>The good news now is that the pace of listings is not stopping as a result of the market falls. The latest IPO in the pipeline is leading contract drug researcher Viva Biotech, which is looking to raise between HK$1.18 bn and HK$1.52 bn ($150 mn to $194 mn). Established in 2008, Viva provides structure-based drug-discovery services to biotechnology and pharmaceutical customers. Its stock will debut on Hong Kong's exchange on May 9.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://d2gw7wlacudg7o.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/field/image/Hong_Kong_5.jpg\">Link to Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">IRMAG-30803</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IRMAG2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WHS-HY71-JB73-154W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">468489</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">1901-11-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"306\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 IR Media Group, LTD All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>irmagazine.com</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>May 1, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>UNDEFINED</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>CC000DKP1</classCode><className>BEIGENE LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>NAICS541714 RESEARCH &amp;

The five-day programme has attracted thousands of attendees across the globe. In his opening speech at the Hong Kong FinTech Week 2019, HKMA Chief Executive Mr Eddie Yue noted fintech development in Hong Kong has gathered remarkable momentum ever since the first FinTech Week three years ago.</p><p><br/><br/>The HKMA also took the chance to highlight a series of initiatives aimed to foster the fintech ecosystem in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>1. Blockchain collaboration with the subsidiary of Institute of Digital Currency of People's Bank of China (PBoC)<br/><br/>Today a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed between the subsidiaries of Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited and Institute of Digital Currency of the PBoC to conduct a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) trial, which aims to connect eTradeConnect (Note) and the PBoC Trade Finance Platform. The PoC is expected to begin in Q1 2020. Once the connection has successfully been established, it will provide firms in both places with more convenient trade finance services and enable banks in Hong Kong to expedite the expansion of their trade finance business.<br/><br/>2. Joint research with Bank of Thailand - Project LionRock-Inthanon<br/><br/>As a follow-up to the MoU signed between the HKMA and the Bank of Thailand in May 2019, the two authorities are conducting a joint research project named Project LionRock-Inthanon to study the application of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) to cross-border payments, with a view to facilitating HKD-THB payment-versus-payment (PvP) among banks in Hong Kong and Thailand. A joint report is scheduled to be released in Q1 2020.<br/><br/>3. Bank of International Settlements (BIS) Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre<br/><br/>The first ever Innovation Hub of BIS commenced its operation in Hong Kong in November 2019, a testimony that Hong Kong stands at the forefront of fintech innovation. The HKMA believes that the Innovation Hub Hong Kong Centre will serve as a focal point for regional fintech collaboration and bring the application of innovative technologies among central banks to a new level. Initially, the HKMA will explore with the Hong Kong Centre on the use of Distributed Ledger Technology to digitalise trade finance processes and study the impact of big tech to financial markets.<br/><br/>4. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Banking<br/><br/>The HKMA is conducting a study on the application of AI technology in the banking industry and will release a series of publications. To begin with, the HKMA published today a fact sheet to highlight the key facts and figures revealed in an industry-wide survey conducted in Q3 2019.  One of the key findings shows almost 90 per cent of the surveyed retail banks have adopted or plan to adopt AI applications. The survey included interviews and questionnaires conducted with banks, industry organisations, and fintech firms, with a view to understanding the current AI landscape in the banking industry. In the coming months, a series of reports will be published.<br/><br/>5. Fin+Tech Collaboration Platform to accelerate innovation and collaboration<br/><br/>The HKMA jointly launched the Fin+Tech Collaboration Platform today with the Hong Kong Science and Technology Parks to support fintech development in a technology-centric approach. Industry players can make use of the platform to organise fintech-related activities such as accelerators and hackathons to explore innovative solutions, identify talents, and seek collaboration opportunities. The HKMA will also make use of the platform's hardware and software facilities for some of its fintech projects (including Project LionRock-Inthanon).<br/><br/>Mr Eddie Yue said, \"The HKMA's fintech initiatives have successfully created a vibrant fintech ecosystem.  To lift Hong Kong's fintech development to a new height, we must take a holistic 'HK Inc.' approach. I look forward to partnering with our stakeholders including financial institutions, end users, start-up firms, technology service providers, investors and regulators to walk towards the shared purposes of driving innovation, enhancing customer experience and facilitating financial inclusion.\"</p><p>Note: eTradeConnect is a blockchain-based trade finance platform officially launched in October 2018 under the facilitation of the HKMA and the platform is fully funded by a consortium of 12 major banks in Hong Kong.</p><p>Source: Hong Kong SAR Government</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HKGNWS-0050263660</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HKGNWS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XFB-NH91-DXMP-K4CH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365278</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"761\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hong Kong Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hong Kong Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 6, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Live from CNN London, I'm Bianca Nobilo in for Hala Gorani.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tonight, a Hong Kong university under siege, the hardest of hard-core protestors barricaded and surrounded while others try to draw police attention away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And near-universal condemnation of Prince Andrew's interview: Should the royal now answer questions under oath? I'll speak to prominent victim attorney Gloria Allred.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And later, anger in Iran: A hike in fuel prices has motivated people to face off with security forces. We'll have the reports and images CNN is managing to get out of the near-complete internet blackout there.</p><p>It's 3:00 a.m. in Hong Kong right now, and there's a tense standoff outside the university where protestors have barricaded themselves over the past week. It's becoming a battleground, and the site of some of the worst violence between police and protestors in five months of unrest.</p><p>Anna Coren explains.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ANNA COREN, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Flames unleash from the parapets of a university turned battlefield. Anti-government demonstrators holed up for a week, now unloading their arsenal of medieval weapons.</p><p>Police moved in early Monday morning, desperate to force the occupiers out on the second day of a siege.</p><p>KWOK KA-CHUEN, HONG KONG POLICE: The university campus has become a powder keg where danger is far beyond what we can estimate.</p><p>COREN (voice-over): A powder keg that blew. Makeshift bombs like this gas cannister turned into a nail bomb, homemade explosives posing as a deadly threat, much of it bursting into flames, columns of smoke lifting from the campus. Police below stood armed with long-barreled assault weapons in view and ready to use, they say.</p><p>The bitter violence left many of the young protestors inside too scared to run. Others made their escape, stealing a moment to get away as supporters worked to distract police outside.</p><p>Officers swooped to make dozens of arrests, taking the tally to almost 5,000 protestors arrested since June.</p><p>KA-CHUEN: Hong Kong has been crippled by violence and public fear for almost half a year now.</p><p>COREN (voice-over): Nearly half a year now that has left Hong Kong often unrecognizable. The city's leader, Carrie Lam, out of sight save for a Facebook post urging people to surrender to police, as the embattled force fought to gain control of the city.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>COREN: There have been ongoing street battled throughout the night between protestors and police. Many of those protestors are now heading home. There are hundreds of them, just filing out of this area where they were clashing with police hurling petrol bombs and setting up barricades. Police, obviously firing multiple rounds of tear gas.</p><p>Now, the plan for the protestors was to divert attention and resources away from Polytechnic University. We saw some incredible images today of protestors inside the campus escaping by scaling down a rope to a waiting motorcycle and being whisked away.</p><p>Now, police have cordoned off this area. No one can get in or out. They are calling on those protestors to surrender in the hope of resolving this peacefully. Bianca, back to you.</p><p>NOBILO: Our thanks to Anna Coren for that. And we'll monitor the situation closely and bring you any updates that we get over the next hour.</p><p>Now, Prince Andrew's attempt to explain his longtime friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein appears to have blown up in his face. The interview, which was the first time the queen's second son has spoken about Epstein, has produced an outcry, with the prince accused of seeming unsympathetic to Epstein's alleged victims.</p><p>Among them, a woman who says that she was forced to have sex with Prince Andrew when she was just 17 years old.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>EMILY MAITLIS, BBC NEWSNIGHT PRESENTER: Are you saying you don't believe her, she's lying?</p><p>ANDREW, PRINCE OF THE UNITED KINGDOM: That's a very difficult thing to answer because I'm not in a position to know what she's trying to achieve. But I can tell you categorically, I don't remember meeting her at all. I do not remember the photograph being taken. And I have said consistently and frequently that we never had any sort of sexual contact whatever.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>[14:05:23]</p><p>NOBILO: Many are also criticizing what's seen as an awkward answer about why Andrew stayed with Epstein for several days in 2010. Have a listen as the prince says that he was too honorable to cut off his relationship with the convicted sex offender.</p><p>MAITLIS: Just trying to work this out. Because you said you went to break up the relationship, and yet you stayed at that New York mansion several days. I'm wondering how long --</p><p>(CROSSTALK)</p><p>ANDREW: But I was doing a number of other things while I was there.</p><p>MAITLIS: But you were staying at the house --</p><p>ANDREW: Yes.</p><p>MAITLIS: -- of a convicted sex offender.</p><p>ANDREW: It was a convenient place to stay. There was -- I mean, I've gone through this in my mind so many times. At the end of the day, with the benefit of all the hindsight that one could have, it was definitely the wrong thing to do. But at the time, I felt it was the -- it was the honorable and right thing to do.</p><p>And I admit fully that my judgment was probably colored by my tendency to be too honorable, but that's just the way it is.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>NOBILO: CNN's Hadas Gold has been following this story and she joins me now. Hadas, I'm sort of incredulous about that argument. Prince Andrew, saying that he's too honorable and that accounts for his actions. It's a very passive understanding of what honor is, to be cognizant of what the right thing is to do and then act upon it. Has anybody in Britain been convinced of that argument?</p><p>HADAS GOLD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I mean, if you're reading the papers and reading the reactions online, I find very few people who thing that this was a smart thing for Prince Andrew to do in a P.R. sense. But also just that his answers were unsatisfactory.</p><p>If he thought this was going to somehow cause the controversy to blow over, draw a line under it, he could move on with all of his work, that seems -- this seems to have caused the opposite effect. And now everybody has even more questions.</p><p>OK, at one point in the interview, you say, Oh, I wasn't that good a friend with Jeffrey Epstein. And then you turn around and say in that clip that you just showed, that he had to go break up the friendship in person? Has he not heard of a phone, has he not heard of maybe not staying at his house that -- it's just kind of -- it's, as you said, it's very incredulous to think about -- that these are his reasonings for it.</p><p>And then also there was some of the awkward sort of alibis he provided. So Virginia Roberts Giuffre, that young woman who has accused him of these allegations, he's saying, oh, I couldn't have been with her because I was taking Princess Beatrice to a Pizza Express.</p><p>He remembers that so specifically, he said, because it's very unusual for me to be at a Pizza Express. But he has absolutely no recollection of meeting this woman, although there is an alleged photograph.</p><p>So it's day two of this story, and still almost every front page in the United Kingdom is focusing on Prince Andrew.</p><p>NOBILO: So by any measure, this really has backfired, this interview. Now, the royal family have a huge P.R. machine. It's fairly mysterious, we don't necessarily know how the decisions are made and who contributes to it. But they do.</p><p>So is this Prince Andrew acting on his own here? He surely wasn't advised that this was a good plan, especially, as you say, his alibis were sketchy, he didn't seem to -- he certainly hasn't dispensed with the criticism of his actions by doing this.</p><p>GOLD: Well, whoever did advise him, the advice, whether it was taken or not, the outcome was that they did end up doing this interview and I think it is also really important to note that it was done in Buckingham Palace. This is the seat of the British monarchy. And clearly, this was -- the Palace obviously knew that this was going to happen, and it was done that way.</p><p>And Emily Maitlis has a really interesting column in \"The Times\" -- she's the anchor -- talking about what the process was like, going into the palace, all the activity around it and how at ease Prince Andrew seemed during the interview. He seemed to think that it was going well.</p><p>Clearly, it's been a little bit of a different story on the other side of it. Really incredible to see the reaction to it. But the bad news for the prince has actually been very good news for the BBC. They said that more than 1.7 million people watched it live on Saturday night; even more are watching it on replays.</p><p>NOBILO: It definitely is what everybody's speaking about in the United Kingdom. And to add insult to injury, Prince Andrew's now become embroiled in another controversy, which has hit the British media today --</p><p>GOLD: Yes.</p><p>NOBILO: -- this over a racist comment that he purportedly made to a Downing Street advisor? Talk to us about that.</p><p>GOLD: Yes. So this came out just a few hours ago -- this is \"The Evening Standard\" tonight -- where they claim that a former Downing Street aide says -- allegedly -- that Prince Andrew used a slur in a conversation, a racial slur in a conversation in 2012.</p><p>Now, a royal source has told CNN they're strenuously denying this, and they've said they've actually even sent a legal letter to \"The Evening Standard,\" strenuously denying this allegation as well. But it shows you that the bad news just keeps coming for Prince Andrew.</p><p>And I have to say it's kind of amazing. I don't think that Prince Andrew is necessarily as much in the headlines before this interview. But after Saturday night, this story is not going anywhere.</p><p>[14:10:06]</p><p>NOBILO: Certainly not. Hadas Gold, thank you very much for joining us and talking us through it, appreciate it.</p><p>And the prince's troubles could be getting worse, as Hadas was just saying. To contribute to this, a prominent victims' rights attorney is calling for him to go to the U.S. to testify about what he knows about Epstein and sex trafficking.</p><p>That attorney is Gloria Allred. She represents several women who say that Jeffrey Epstein abused them, and she joins me now live from Los Angeles. Gloria, thank you very much for joining the program today and being with us --</p><p>GLORIA ALLRED, VICTIMS' RIGHTS ATTORNEY: Thank you -- thank you.</p><p>NOBILO: Firstly, I'm curious to know if any of the victims who you represent have had a reaction that they've expressed to you about this interview that Prince Andrew has done.</p><p>ALLRED: Well, no. But we are about to have a press conference with one of Jeffrey Epstein's victims and she will react and that's very, very important. And we also have filed a lawsuit for her this morning in federal court, and so we will be litigating that case for her.</p><p>And I would say, as to Prince Andrew, he's concerned about doing what is honorable and what is right. And so I urge him to volunteer to speak to federal law enforcement and share what he knows, not only about Mr. Epstein but about Ms. Maxwell and anyone else that was in Mr. Epstein's circle.</p><p>Because there is still an ongoing serious intense criminal investigation by the United States Justice Department for the Southern District of New York into anyone else who may have conspired with Mr. Epstein to sex-traffic underage girls.</p><p>And so we need the truth, we need justice for the victims. They should not be just a footnote in all of this. If Prince Andrew wants to help and cares about the victims, this is what he will do. He doesn't need to get the OK from his attorneys if he hasn't committed any crime. Let him just say yes, I will help now. I will speak to them this week, as soon as possible.</p><p>NOBILO: Gloria, there has been a reaction to the interview -- well, many, but specifically one of surprise at the lack of remorse that Prince Andrew showed towards the victims and sort of nonchalance in the way that he spoke about Jeffrey Epstein.</p><p>And then he spoke about Ghislaine Maxwell in fairly warm term. Do both of those things surprise you?</p><p>ALLRED: Well, apparently Ms. Maxwell and the prince have been friends for many, many years. At one point, he had described Jeffrey Epstein as just a plus one for Ms. Maxwell. Well, obviously, Mr. Epstein became a lot more than a plus one to Prince Andrew.</p><p>So it's time for him to step up. And I might add, if he is asked to testify in any civil case as well where his information may be relevant to the civil cases that these underage minors are bringing -- they're adults now, but they were underage when they were sexually victimized by Mr. Epstein -- then he should also take the oath, tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help him God, in those civil cases as well. And not make victims jump through legal hoops in order to get him to sit there and tell what he knows, because it could be very, very relevant.</p><p>And whatever his feelings are, we just want the facts. That's all we want from Mr. -- from Prince Andrew and from anyone else (ph). Whether a person is a prince or a pauper, they should provide relevant information.</p><p>NOBILO: Gloria, you've said that you want an explanation as to how Prince Andrew didn't notice the underage girls that were so frequently at Epstein's properties. And you say that you don't understand how that could have passed him by.</p><p>Now, his defense in that interview with Emily Maitlis was that people behaved differently around him, and that he certainly didn't notice those other girls. The implication being that even if those things happened, they didn't happen around him. How credible do you think that is as a defense?</p><p>ALLRED: You know, it really doesn't matter if he -- if the young women were sexually victimized by Mr. Epstein right in front of him. What matters is, he described Mr. Epstein's home and that was the home he stayed in in New York. He also stayed in Mr. Epstein's (INAUDIBLE) beach (ph) and in the Virgin Islands, where underage girls were in all of those locations. It doesn't matter if he saw a crime being committed in front of him.</p><p>[14:15:03]</p><p>What matters is, why didn't he even ask, why are all these teens and maybe a preteen, look around this home. What are they doing here? Are they living here? Are they working here? Are they going to school? Where are their parents? Why are they here? I mean, the excuse that somehow he's used to a lot of staff being around, it just doesn't pass, you know, the laugh test. Because it's so unusual for anyone's staff to be a young girl under the age of 18.</p><p>So, you know, as they say in the South in the United States, he's got a lot of 'splaining to do. And he ought to start explaining as soon as possible in these serious civil cases and the criminal investigation.</p><p>NOBILO: Gloria Allred, thanks for joining the program today. Appreciate your time.</p><p>ALLRED: Thanks.</p><p>NOBILO: Still ahead on the show, we could soon see the most consequential testimony yet in the U.S. impeachment inquiry. An official who has acknowledged delivering a quid pro quo message to Ukraine will be one of eight witnesses on Capitol Hill this week.</p><p>Plus, a new frontrunner emerges in Iowa: where the Democratic candidates stand less than two months before voters make their choices known.</p><p>NOBILO: We're now just a day away from the beginning of a second round of hearings in the U.S. impeachment inquiry. And this week could very well provide the biggest bombshells yet: Eight witnesses are scheduled to testify including one who's already acknowledged delivering a quid pro quo message to Ukraine. CNN's Lauren Fox has the details.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>LAUREN FOX, CNN CONGRESSIONAL REPORTER (voice-over): Eight key witnesses are set to testify publicly in the impeachment inquiry this week, including Ambassador to the E.U. Gordon Sondland, who is emerging as the most pivotal witness in the proceedings.</p><p>WILLIAM TAYLOR, FORMER AMBASSADOR TO UKRAINE: A member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone, asking Ambassador Sondland about the investigations. Mr. Sondland told President Trump the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.</p><p>FOX (voice-over): In his closed-door deposition, former national security official Tim Morrison, who is slated to testify tomorrow, said he knew of at least five direct conversations between Sondland and Trump, adding that Sondland was acting at Trump's direction.</p><p>Morrison said Sondland told him that he informed a Ukrainian official the nearly $400 million in military aid for Ukraine could be freed up if, quote, \"the prosecutor general would go to the mic and announce that he was opening the Burisma investigation.\"</p><p>REP. SEAN MALONEY (D-NY): What we're talking about here is that the president of the United States used taxpayer-funded military assistance to pressure a foreign leader to help him in his re-election campaign. That is solicitation of a bribe.</p><p>[14:20:00]</p><p>FOX (voice-over): \"The Wall Street Journal,\" reporting this morning on e- mails that show Sondland \"kept several Trump administration officials apprised of his effort,\" including Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, and Energy Secretary Rick Perry.</p><p>REP. MIKE TURNER (R-OH): As I've said from the beginning, I think this is -- this is not OK. The president of the United States shouldn't, even in the original phone call, be on the phone with the president of another country and raise his political opponent.</p><p>But if you look at Sondland's testimony, which is also public, he says that the direction that he received from the president of the United States was no quid pro quo.</p><p>FOX (voice-over): President Trump, again lashing out at another witness in a tweet.</p><p>TEXT: Donald J. Trump: Tell Jennifer Williams, whoever that is, to read BOTH transcripts of the presidential calls, and see the just released statement (sic) from Ukraine. Then she should meet with the other Never Trumpers, who I don't know and mostly never even heard of, and work out a better presidential attack!</p><p>FOX (voice-over): In a transcript released this weekend, Jennifer Williams, a State Department employee detailed to the vice president's office, who listened to the July 25th phone call between President Trump and the Ukrainian president. She told impeachment investigators President Trump's request for a specific investigation struck her as, quote, \"unusual and inappropriate.\"</p><p>Vice President Mike Pence's office is making a concerted effort to distance itself from Williams, who is slated to testify tomorrow, releasing a statement emphasizing, quote, \"Jennifer is a State Department employee.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: The White House is still blocking other witnesses at the heart of this scandal from testifying. But now, President Trump suggests he himself would be willing to talk to Congress. He tweeted that he likes the idea, and says he will strongly consider it in order to get Congress focused again.</p><p>Well, we've heard something similar before. Remember when Mr. Trump said he was willing to talk to Special Counsel Robert Mueller? He never did, and submitted written answers instead. Now, in yet another major development, we're learning that the House is investigating whether Mr. Trump may have lied to Mueller in those written answers.</p><p>Let's bring in CNN White House reporter Stephen Collinson to work through all of this with us. Stephen, there's been a couple of things that have happened over the past few days in typical Trump administration style. There's also been this unexplained hospital visit in the press as well. Help us kind of navigate our way through all the controversies and news that we've seen over the last 24, 48 hours.</p><p>STEPHEN COLLINSON, CNN WHITE HOUSE REPORTER: Right, Bianca. Well, there's never really any weekend in the Trump administration. You mentioned that hospital visit, which is a slightly surprising occurrence given that generally when a president goes for his annual checkup in Bethesda Naval Hospital or Walter Reed just north of Washington, it's announced in advance, they go up there in their helicopter.</p><p>This was rather sudden and unannounced. The president took -- went up there 15 miles or so in his motorcade. That, of course, raised all sorts of questions about whether this was a routine visit, as the White House said, or whether the White House wasn't perhaps being completely truthful.</p><p>This White House really doesn't get much benefit of the doubt, given the somewhat estranged relationship with the truth that the president has had throughout his administration. So that's one thing.</p><p>On the other hand, all of these new developments happening over the weekend -- new depositions were released by the House impeachment inquiry, which appear to tie the president closer to a direct role in ordering this pressure on Ukraine to conduct an investigation into his potential 2020 opponent Joe Biden.</p><p>So this is all boiling up and the week ahead, the next four days, could be the most crucial, as you said, in the impeachment inquiry so far. We're all looking for that testimony on Wednesday with Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the E.U. who appears to be emerging as President Trump's prime contact with the Ukrainian government.</p><p>NOBILO: And, Stephen, as we ramp up to this critical week in the impeachment inquiry, do you detect any sort of deviation or change in the president's strategy to all of this, insofar as we can call it that? Or perhaps his behavior in general?</p><p>COLLINSON: I think what we've seen over the last few days is interesting. These are direct attacks on witnesses by the president. We saw it on Friday during the testimony of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine. The president attacked her testimony in real time and it was read out to her by Adam Schiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.</p><p>We saw the president attacking Jennifer Williams, somebody who worked in the -- Vice President Mike Pence's office yesterday on Twitter. So it does seem that the president is trying to at least lean on some of these witnesses, perhaps to get them to think twice about what they might say before the committee.</p><p>Of course, some Democrats are saying that this actually amounts to witness tampering, and this could be something that could be folded into the eventual articles of impeachment that the House is expected to vote on during perhaps December.</p><p>NOBILO: Stephen Collinson, always good to talk to you. Thanks very much for joining us from Washington.</p><p>Also in the U.S., a new frontrunner is surging ahead as Democrats look for a candidate to take on President Trump next year.</p><p>[14:25:10]</p><p>According to a new CNN-Des Moines Register poll, Mayor Pete Buttigieg has now a strong lead in the state of Iowa, which holds the first caucus for voters to make their preferences known. Senator Elizabeth Warren is second, while former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders are close behind her. Senator Amy Klobuchar, far behind in fifth place.</p><p>Buttigieg is the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who was little known nationally before joining the presidential race. And if he won, he'd be the first openly gay U.S. president.</p><p>For more now, Vanessa Yurkevich joins me from New York. Vanessa, what is it about Buttigieg which is causing this surge in the polls? Is it just that he's not as far-left as Warren and Sanders and a little bit more exciting and novel than Biden?</p><p>VANESSA YURKEVICH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Well, it's a little bit of all of that. He is a more moderate candidate, and he is a little bit of a newcomer to this scene. But what we can really attribute that jump in the polls to is his organizing in the state of Iowa. He's raised a ton of money, and his campaign is really putting it to good use.</p><p>In September, they opened 20 field offices alone. They have over a hundred staffers now, and they're also targeting opening offices in more rural communities. And that's in places that other campaigns simply don't have the funds to be able to open offices in more rural communities.</p><p>But it's important to point out that this is one poll. And the top candidates -- Warren, Biden and Sanders along with Buttigieg -- have sort of been trading top spots in these polls for a number of weeks now.</p><p>And also, when you look at Buttigieg and how he's polling in Iowa, it's significant that he is in front. But this race is so fluid and the charge for his campaign is really going to be to try to keep this momentum up as we go into that Iowa caucus February 3rd. Because our poll also reveals, Bianca, that about two-thirds of voters still haven't made up their mind about who they're going to be voting for -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: And, Vanessa, of course you're right to caution on the polling. We have to be very careful anyway, like you say, voter volatility's high and it's just one poll. And there are many undecideds, as you mentioned.</p><p>But where does this surge that we're seeing, Buttigieg, fit into other national polls that we've seen, other samples that we've seen in early voting states, swing states, things like that?</p><p>YURKEVICH: Right. So Buttigieg is doing very well in Iowa. Also in New Hampshire, he's rising in the polls. But when you start to look at the national polls, he's polling in the single digits. And then when you look at early voting states like Nevada and South Carolina, he's also in the single digits.</p><p>And the Buttigieg campaign is keenly aware that they especially have a lot of work to do in South Carolina. In South Carolina, there's a huge voting bloc of African-American voters and the campaign realizes that in order to win the Democratic nomination, you have to do well with African-American voters, specifically in South Carolina.</p><p>But also in our new poll, it reveals that about only 27 percent of Buttigieg's own supporters think that he can beat President Trump, and we know that is really the number one issue for voters across the country: Who can beat President Trump? So only 27 percent of his voters think he can do it compared, Bianca, with someone like Joe Biden who, in our same poll, it reveals that about 57 percent of Joe Biden's supporters think he can beat the president.</p><p>So while there's a good performance coming out of this poll for Mayor Pete Buttigieg, electability could be a big question mark as we look down the line -- Bianca.</p><p>NOBILO: Vanessa Yurkevich, thank you. We know you'll keep an eye on that for us. Good to hear from you.</p><p>Still to come on the program, a CNN exclusive interview: A top Iraqi official says there's evidence that ISIS is trying to make a big comeback.</p><p>MIKE POMPEO, SECRETARY OF STATE: We condemn strongly any acts of violence committed by this regime against the Iranian people, and are deeply concerned by reports of several fatalities. We've been at that since the beginning of this administration.</p><p>[14:29:59]</p><p>The Islamic Republic must cease violence against its own people and should immediately restore the ability of all Iranians to access a free and open internet. The world is watching. The Iranian people will enjoy a better future when their government begins to respect basic human rights, abandon its revolutionary posture and its destabilizing foreign policy in the region and behave simply like a normal nation. The choice is clearly with the regime. Continue with Iran.</p><p>President Rouhani recently announced that Iran will begin uranium enrichment activities at the Fordow facility. Therefore, the United States will terminate the sanctions waiver related to the nuclear facility at Fordow effective December 15th, 2019.</p><p>The right amount of uranium enrichment for the world's largest state- sponsor of terror is zero. Iran originally constructed Fordow as a fortified underground bunker to conduct secret uranium enrichment work. And there is no legitimate reason for Iran to resume enrichment at this previously clandestine site.</p><p>Iran should reverse its activity there immediately. Iran's supreme leader is reverting to his tried and true method using nuclear brinkmanship to extort the international community into accepting the regime's destabilizing activity. The United States rejects this approach completely, and calls on all nations to do the same.</p><p>The only viable way forward is through comprehensive negotiation to address the full range of Iran's threats in their entirety. Iran's most recent action is yet another clear attempt at nuclear extortion that will only deepen its political and economic isolation from the world.</p><p>I also want to spend just a minute talking about Iraq. The last few weeks, United States has watched the protests very, very closely. We support the Iraqi people as they strive for a prosperous Iraq that is free of corruption and Iranian maligned influence.</p><p>We stated clearly that Iraq's leaders must protect human rights as Iraqis lift their voices just to cure a flourishing democracy. Calls are consistent with the Trump administration's track record as being a force for good throughout Iraq.</p><p>We work with Iraqi security forces to take down the ISIS caliphate and we'll continue to make sure it cannot reemerge.</p><p>The United States remains the largest humanitarian donor to Iraq providing more than $2 billion in food, water, medicine, and shelter since 2014 alone. We're the largest donor as well to stabilization. We built more than 500 schools, 100 health centers, 50 water treatment plants with many more projects coming on line soon.</p><p>Now our commitment continues, we will not stand idle while the corrupt officials make the Iraqi people suffer. Today, I'm affirming the United States will use our legal authorities to sanction corrupt individuals that are stealing Iraqi's wealth and those killing and wounding peaceful protesters.</p><p>Like the Iraqi people, taking to the streets that our sanctions will not discriminate between religious sect or ethnicity. They will simply target those who do wrong to the Iraqi people no matter who they are.</p><p>Turning now to Israel. The Trump administration is reversing the Obama administration's approach towards Israeli settlements. U.S. public statements on settlement activities in the West Bank have been inconsistent over decades.</p><p>In 1978, the Carter administration categorically concluded that Israel's establishment of civilian settlements was inconsistent with international law.</p><p>However, in 1981, President Reagan disagree with that conclusion and stated that he didn't believe that the settlements were inherently illegal.</p><p>Subsequent administrations recognized that unrestrained settlement activity could be an obstacle to peace. But they wisely and prudently recognized the dwelling on illegal positions didn't advance peace.</p><p>However in December 2016 at the very end of the previous administration, Secretary Kerry changed decades of this careful bipartisan approach by publicly reaffirming the illegality of settlements.</p><p>After carefully studying all sides of the legal debate, this administration agrees with President Reagan. The establishment of Israeli civilian settlements in the West Bank is not, per se, inconsistent with international law.</p><p>I want to emphasize several important considerations. First, look, we recognize that -- as Israeli courts have the legal conclusions relating to individual settlements must depend on an assessment of specific facts and circumstances on the ground.</p><p>Therefore, the United States Government is expressing no view on the legal status of any individual settlement.</p><p>The Israeli legal system affords an opportunity to challenge settlement activity and assess humanitarian considerations connected to it. Israeli courts have confirmed the legality of certain settlement activities and has concluded that others cannot be legally sustained.</p><p>[14:35:13]</p><p>Second, we're not addressing or prejudging the ultimate status of the West Bank. This is for the Israelis and the Palestinians to negotiate. International law does not compel a particular outcome, nor create any legal obstacle to a negotiated resolution.</p><p>Third, the conclusion that we will no longer recognize Israeli settlements as per se inconsistent with international law is based on the unique facts, history, and circumstances presented by the establishment of civilian settlements in the West Bank. Our decision today does not prejudice or decide legal conclusions regarding situations in any other parts of the world.</p><p>And finally, finally, calling the establishment of civilian settlements inconsistent with international law hasn't worked. It hasn't advanced the cause of peace.</p><p>The hard truth is, there will never be a judicial resolution to the conflict and arguments about who is right and wrong as a matter of international law will not bring peace.</p><p>This is a complex political problem that can only be solved by negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.</p><p>The United States remains deeply committed to helping facilitate peace, and I will do everything I can to help this cause.</p><p>The United States encourages the Israelis and the Palestinians to resolve the status of Israeli settlements in the West Bank in any final status negotiations.</p><p>And further, we encourage both sides to find a solution that promotes, protects the security and welfare of Palestinians and Israelis alike.</p><p>Turning now to Hong Kong. The United States is gravely concerned by the deepening political unrest and violence in Hong Kong including the standoff between protesters and police at Hong Kong Polytechnic University and other campuses. We call for restraint from all parties in Hong Kong.</p><p>Violence by any side is unacceptable. The Hong Kong government bears primary responsibility for bringing calm to Hong Kong. Unrest and violence could not be resolved by law enforcement efforts alone. The government must take clear steps to address public concerns.</p><p>In particular, we call on chief executive, Carrie Lam, to protagonist accountability by supplementing the independent police complaints accounts overview with an independent investigation into the protest related incidents.</p><p>As the United States government has said repeatedly, the Chinese communist party must honor its promises to the Hong Kong people who only want the freedoms and liberties that they have been promised in the signing of British joint declaration, a U.N. filed treaty.</p><p>And finally, Bolivia. The Bolivian government announced Friday the expulsion of hundreds of Cuban officials for their country. It was the right thing to do.</p><p>Cuba wasn't sending doctors and officials to Bolivia to help the Bolivian people, but rather to prop up a pro-Cuba regime headed by Evo Morales who sought to maintain his grip on power through electoral fraud.</p><p>Bolivia now joins Brazil and Ecuador in recognizing the Cuban threat --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>BIANCA NOBILO, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Let's get more now on this massive U.S. policy change that we've just been hearing about from U.S. secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, there on the settlements in the West Bank.</p><p>We're now joined by CNN's Oren Liebermann who's in Jerusalem.</p><p>Oren, what's your reaction to what we've just heard from Mike Pompeo?</p><p>OREN LIEBERMANN, CNN JERUSALEM CORRESPONDENT: As you pointed out, it's a massive announcement but not all that a surprising of an announcement given the policies of the Trump administration in the years that I've been following this and their peace efforts. The administration stopped calling the occupied West Bank occupied instead calling it disputed.</p><p>Jason Greenblatt, the former head of the peace team said he didn't want to call them settlements at all. He simply wanted to call them cities and towns or villages. All of that was moving away from the idea that the West Bank was occupied territory according to at least the U.S., although it certainly remains as such under international law.</p><p>Who benefits from this? Well, no doubt this is a boost to President Donald Trump himself and his voter base, the religious evangelical voter base that sees Israel as a very important issue and this will speak right to them.</p><p>There are two other conspicuous elements of timing here. First, this seems a slap in the face or at least an attempted one to the European Union and the court of justice there, which had just ruled last week that goods produced in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank have to be labelled as such.</p><p>It can't just say made in Israel or has to say made in an Israeli settlement in the West Bank or something a kin to that. This seems to be a slap in the face of that ruling, and simply saying the U.S. won't follow it.</p><p>It is also whether intentional or not a very big boost to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu who is in perhaps his most perilous political situation, I would say over the last few years, and perhaps of his political career.</p><p>He will claim victory for this. He will say he's been pushing for it all along. And it has been in the works, according to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo for the past year, and it gives him a political boost when is desperately in need of one if he hopes to remain prime minister.</p><p>[14:40:05]</p><p>NOBILO: Oren Liebermann in Jerusalem, thank you so much for explaining that surprise decision as it might seem to us on the surface. But as you explained there are antecedents to that to go back a long way certainly under this administration. Thank you.</p><p>And we'll continue to monitor the secretary of state's remarks as he's continuing to make them now. We'll update if there's any policy announcements you need to know about.</p><p>Now, Iraq's chief military intelligence officer has a grave warning. He says that ISIS is planning to rebuild its terror operation from the rubble of its so-called caliphate.</p><p>Communication show how senior ISIS members are planning to break prisoners out of jails in Syria and Iraq. And in Turkey, wealthy conspirators are returning and forming new cells.</p><p>Sam Kiley brings us this exclusive report.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>SAM KILEY, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): Hidden among those fleeing the last stand of the so-called Islamic caliphate, are leaders who evaded prisons like these taking refuge in Turkey.</p><p>Flush with millions of dollars and driven by revenge, they're plotting mass jail breakouts to rebuild the terror network. These explosive warnings come from Iraq's veteran head of military intelligence in an exclusive interview with CNN.</p><p>LT. GEN. SAAD AL-ALLAQ, HEAD OF IRAQI MILITARY INTELLIGENCE: (through translator): Those elements who are currently in areas in Turkey play a key role in the new effort to recruit fighters.</p><p>Top-level leaders who fled secretly in the direction of Gaziantep and other areas are key funding members of the organization, and they have vast amounts of money. They even have investments in Turkey.</p><p>KILEY: The general said that he handed a dossier of nine ISIS leaders to Turkish military officials in this room a month ago. We were shown but not allowed to film Iraqi arrest warrants for two of those men which said that they're expert bomb makers and wanted for terror and mass murder. The warrants say they pose a great danger in the Middle East and to the West. Turkish officials told CNN that they're looking into the allegations.</p><p>Iraq trapped and attacked former ISIS leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, forcing him from Iraq into Syria where he was eventually killed in October. But the general warned that the ISIS threat remains potent.</p><p>About 10,000 alleged fighters are now held in prisons guarded by the Syrian Democratic Forces. How long they can be contained is unclear since Turkey's recent incursion into the area where it considers the Kurdish elements of the SDF a terror group.</p><p>The Trump administration has been widely criticized for withdrawing U.S. forces who were working with the SDF from the border area. European forces have done nothing to help contain the potential threat here and most refuse to repatriate their citizens who joined ISIS.</p><p>Turkish forces have rounded up dozens of alleged ISIS members, recently arresting 42 people allegedly involved in complex money transfers for the terror group.</p><p>But Iraqi military intelligence believes that these prisons and others like it could be attacked at any time. Funded by ISIS leaders living in Turkey.</p><p>AL-ALLAQ (through translator): We have concluded that the real intention of ISIS is to begin a mission they're calling breakdown defenses, to storm jails inside Iraq and Syria to free terrorists.</p><p>KILEY (on camera): And what do you think should be done about them?</p><p>AL-ALLAQ (through translator): There should be a large international effort to deal with this because these criminals could escape camps and go back to their countries. They pose a great danger to countries in Europe, Asia, and North Africa.</p><p>KILEY: In the nation where the terrorist caliphate first emerged, a warning that it still has the money and the intent to be reborn.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: Sam Kiley is here with me to discuss his exclusive piece.</p><p>Sam, you were asking the chief military intelligence officer at the end there what can to be done about this and he said an international effort is required. But as you outlined there, it's not exactly fertile ground for concerted effort from all of these regional players.</p><p>So what does happen? How can this tide be stemmed.</p><p>KILEY: Well, the first thing is that somebody's got to step in to the gap left by the withdrawal or reduction in American forces there in terms of -- this would certainly be the position of the Trump administration. And I think he's got a lot of support from this, ironically, both from the Kurds, the Iraqis, and even the Turks, which is the European military could be doing a great deal more in that area to secure, for example, those camps, 10,000 potential fighters in one prison, 70,000 women and children in another, an incubator arguably for future ISIS youngsters, people that need to be rescued effectively from what is terrorist grooming.</p><p>Very little, if anything, is being done. And as a result of that we're already seeing President Erdogan has started expelling people alleged with -- to have ISIS contact back to this country and others very much against their will.</p><p>[14:45:03]</p><p>But there has not been a European response and it's quite fascinating given the level of threat, not just from terrorism but from the potential floodgates that the Turks have threatened to open in terms of refugees being allowed to restart crossing into Greece again.</p><p>So there's an awful lot of interest that the Europeans should have in that environment. It's quite fascinating that they're being so hands off. They've done everything up until now entirely through the American prison.</p><p>NOBILO: And just quickly because we've got to go. But is there any sign that they are trying to coordinate some type of response, the efforts are being made between any of these countries to come up with something?</p><p>KILEY: You sort of time, the answer is no. None at all. I mean, it's absolute -- it is quite stark. I mean, the British have Special Forces on the ground working with the Americans, the Danes, French do too, but they've had to scale back operations as the Americans have.</p><p>And at the moment, there is no -- nobody is stepping forward to secure these camps that are being guarded by Syrian Democratic Forces that are simultaneously being drawn off to try to at least block what they would see as a Turkish incursion into their territory.</p><p>NOBILO: Sam Kiley, thank you very much for joining us. (inaudible) now.</p><p>In Iran, nationwide demonstrations are gripping the country. Protesters took to the streets on Friday after the government announced a fuel price hike. Now, leaders are warning of a crackdown.</p><p>CNN's Phil Black reports.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>PHIL BLACK, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): The few videos now emerging from Iran showed brief chaotic moments. Security forces firing weapons. Banks and other buildings severely damaged by fire.</p><p>(GUNSHOTS)</p><p>Crowds of people, some running in fear. Others together determined and chanting against the Iranian government.</p><p>In this video, people linger in the eerie, smoky aftermath of violence in the city of Shiraz. The world's view events in Iran has been narrowed by an almost total internet blackout.</p><p>But these images which have surfaced on social media appeared to show a sudden dramatic outpouring of anger across the country by people fed up with tough economic conditions and what they see as corrupt leadership.</p><p>American sanctions designed to change Iran's behavior in the region are already biting hard. Now, the government wants to increase the price of petrol by at least half with steeper hikes for those who exceed strict rationing.</p><p>The Iranian government says the price increase is necessary to help Iran's poorest families and it blames the United States for encouraging riots and sabotage.</p><p>Phil Black, CNN, London.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>[14:50:04]</p><p>NOBILO: In the middle of a desolate part of South Africa sits one of the most advanced radio telescopes in the world. Eleni Giokos shows us for our \"INNOVATE AFRICA\" series.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ELENI GIOKOS, CNN BUSINESS AFRICA CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At the South African Radio Astronomy Observatory, brilliant minds are monitoring dark skies and bright stars, looking for answers.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: At the legend, this is where you see all the antennas. I can believe everything and just choose to see one.</p><p>GIOKOS: Here in the Northern Cape, a radio telescope called MeerKAT is bringing the sky online for astronomers near and far to use.</p><p>FERNANDO CAMILO, CHIEF SCIENTIST, SOUTH AFRICAN RADIO ASTRONOMY OBSERVATORY: South Africa's beautiful dark skies where you can really see the sky very well with your eyes. And, of course, it has radio-quiet spaces where we can build a radio telescope.</p><p>South Africa was interested in bringing to the country a mega-science project. And so, MeerKAT was built in part to essentially show that South Africa is ready to host such a high-tech international project.</p><p>Radio astronomy is a relatively new science. Radio waves come from to us from galaxies stars across the universe. So making images with a telescope like MeerKAT is very different than taking a photo with a camera or an ordinary telescope.</p><p>So, first, you collect the radio signals that hit each of our 64 antennas separately. So that combination of having many, many dishes and also separated widely up to eight kilometers gives this unique capability to MeerKAT to make really, really high fidelity, sharp images.</p><p>GIOKOS: Scientists all over the world use this data to investigate mysteries of the galaxies.</p><p>CAMILO: So, the first major discovery that MeerKAT made, it was reported in the journal, Nature. It's the discovery of these two big radio bubbles at the Milky Way Center (INAUDIBLE) center of the galaxy where there's a massive black hole.</p><p>People have been looking at the galactic center for decades with radio telescopes. But ours had some unique capabilities that allowed us to make this discovery that nobody have ever seen before.</p><p>South Africa has emerged as a real player in the world leagues, radio astronomy in just about 15 years. I mean, 15 years ago, there was something like half a dozen radio astronomers in South Africa. And now, one of the world's best radio telescopes is in South Africa.</p><p>GIOKOS: As MeerKAT continues to look into the past, the telescope is securing South Africa's astronomy status into the future as it expands into a larger project over the next decade.</p><p>Eleni Giokos, for \"INNOVATE AFRICA.\"</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>NOBILO: We want to focus on big tech and the power that it has over our lives.</p><p>According to CNN's global economic analysis, it's too much. Rana Foroohar talks about this in her new book, \"Don't Be Evil How Big Tech Betrayed its Founding Principles and All of Us.\" And she joins me now.</p><p>So let's start there. These big tech companies began with utopian visions for how they might affect humanity, Google, Facebook, et cetera.</p><p>And now they are certainly dystopic elements. I mean, which parts of our lives do you think we should be most fearful of big tech's influence?</p><p>RANA FOROOHAR, CNN GLOBAL ECONOMIC ANALYST: Well, you know, one of the things I try and do in my book which is really a 20-year arc going from that utopia in the mid-1990s to the real dystopia today, is to connect all the dots.</p><p>So I look at the economic, the monopoly power that these firms hold, which is really a very similar to the 19th century railroads. I mean, they own the networks, they own what goes on in the networks.</p><p>I look at the political, not only the use of platform technology and election meddling, but also the fact that these firms are the largest lobbyists in the world.</p><p>[14:55:05]</p><p>Now, they're in New York, in London, in Brussels, in Washington, you know, trying to get regulators to do their bidding. And then the cognitive effects. And this actually goes to kind of a personal story.</p><p>One of the reasons I got interested in writing this book is that my own son was really captured and sort of pulled down the rabbit hole of a supposedly free video game, was then drawn in through what's called persuasive technology. It sounds very Orwellian but it actually combines casino gaming techniques with behavioral not just to sort of pull you through and get you spending money within the game. And this is how most games operate. I mean, the apps like Fortnite, you know, have hundreds of behavioral nudges.</p><p>This is happening. This kind of surveillance capitalism is all around us now and it really begs the question, how much choice do we have? Are we making our own decisions? Or the algorithms making them for us?</p><p>NOBILO: So, do you think there is a concern that these algorithms, as they start to increase more into our lives are actually depriving us of free will and we don't even realize it?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I do. I mean, you know, it's amazing at this point how much algorithm programs know about you. I mean, you think about just -- not just what you do online, how your eyes move when you're looking at a screen. But where you go if you have an android phone, it knows that when you're in a supermarket. If you're in a smart car, it knows where you drive.</p><p>As we move out, not just from the consumer internet but to the internet of things where there's sensors all over in smart cities, you're going to be surveilled all the time.</p><p>And, you know, take this to the dark side, you can see in China, for example, a country in which there really is a surveillance state and there's not a debate around privacy like we have in Europe or in the U.S. You have a system of social credits where if you're doing or saying approved things, you may do better in your job or get special benefits. If you're doing or saying the wrong things, you may not have access to a mortgage or to healthcare.</p><p>We need to have a debate before this goes any further, a transparent public debate and not have the biggest companies in the world making up their own rules.</p><p>NOBILO: So we don't have much time. Just one reason that we have to be optimistic, one green shoot that maybe some of this is in-hand?</p><p>FOROOHAR: I think the fact that there's public outrage building. You know, it's interesting. A lot of this reminds me of the great financial crisis in the sense that it was a complex topic.</p><p>But when people finally got a narrative that made sense, they said, hey, you know what, big banks have to take some responsibility for their actions.</p><p>I think we're at that point now and the public at large is saying, you know what? We need to debate about the rules of surveillance capitalism.</p><p>NOBILO: Rana Foroohar, it's wonderful to speak to you. Good to see you in person.</p><p>FOROOHAR: Thanks for having me.</p><p>NOBILO: And thank you for watching tonight.

And here is what you need to know.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Violence escalating. Hong Kong protest leaves two people in critical condition.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And ready to run - Saudi Aramco releases more details ahead of its highly anticipated IPO.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And let the shipping begin. Alibaba breaks its Singles Day record with more than $30 billion in sales.</p><p>It is Monday, my friends, and this is FIRST MOVE.</p><p>ANNOUNCER: This is CNN Breaking News.</p><p>ASHER: All right, first we have breaking news to bring you from Hong Kong, a shocking surge of violence has led to a 21-year-old being shot by police while a man who confronted protesters was doused in gasoline and set on fire.</p><p>Office workers were sent home earlier as protesters gathered in Hong Kong's central district rushing for train amid shouts of teargas, teargas. Video of the shooting by police was shared online and we want to warn you, it is extremely graphic.</p><p>An officer is seen grappling with a protester, when another approaches, and the officer raises his gun and then shoots the protester at close range. The victim is said to be in critical condition in hospital.</p><p>Ivan Watson joins us live now from Hong Kong. So Ivan, just set the scene for us there. What are Hong Kong Police saying? How are they responding to accusations of excessive violence?</p><p>IVAN WATSON, CNN SENIOR INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Well, they're defending the actions of the police. They're saying that in the case of the shooting, Zain, that the officer was firing in self-defense.</p><p>Meanwhile, here in the Mong Kok neighborhood, we have another face off. Demonstrators setting up barricades and several hundred meters down this road here, in normally what would be a busy commercial district, riot police who have been firing teargas down this direction as the demonstrators have been setting fires and committing acts of vandalism around here.</p><p>In one of the cases that the police had to address today, it involved a man on a motorcycle, a police officer swerving wildly smashing into demonstrators. The police saying that police officer's case, they have suspended that officer from frontline duty and they're investigating the incident.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, that's the first time in more than five months that a police officer has been suspended in this cycle of violence that is basically a low-level urban conflict at this stage.</p><p>And there are no signs coming from the city authorities, of any de- escalation. The Chief Executive Carrie Lam fresh from being endorsed face- to-face with the Chinese President Xi Jinping has basically said it's my road or the high road, and the demonstrators have grown more violent and more radicalized as this process has gone on.</p><p>It feels like on the part of the law enforcement and on the part of radical protesters like this, it's a race to the bottom -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: So Ivan, just recap for our audience what the protesters are demanding at this point. We know that the Extradition Bill which was hugely controversial and one of their key demands was actually withdrawn. What more do the protesters want from Hong Kong authorities at this point?</p><p>WATSON: Well, they have a list of five demands, everything from universal suffrage to the release of all the protesters that have been detained. There you can see some of the fires in the distance that they lit.</p><p>But there are a lot of calls for basically anarchy and revolution at this stage. One of the slogans is, if we burn, you burn with us, and the entire city is suffering from this Zain. It's gone into an economic recession and the stock market, the Hang Seng Index fell two and a half points today, the biggest drop in more than three months.</p><p>Every business person you talk to in the city -- services, hotels, retail, tourism industry -- they are all hurting very badly right now. And once again, there is no sign of any let up anytime soon.</p><p>[09:05:07]</p><p>WATSON: The authorities have arrested more than 3,000 people. There's a growing number of casualties in hospital on the side of the police, on the side of young people like this, who are out day after day. They called for a general strike on Monday, and they're calling for another strike to continue on Tuesday, though we did not see signs of large numbers of laborers around the city joining into that strike -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: And Ivan, if authorities don't yield to the protesters' demands, what happens next? Obviously Carrie Lam has come out and said listen, violence isn't going to change things, but surely at some point, something has to give.</p><p>WATSON: Yes, but this has been going on for more than five months, and the message that I think we've gotten from Beijing -- after all, this is a part of China -- from the Hong Kong authorities is they'll just keep going with this low-level urban war of attrition, and this is what you see as a result of it.</p><p>Four or five months ago, these were peaceful protests, massive ones, with one to two million people in the streets calling for a controversial piece of legislation -- hang on -- controversial piece of legislation to be removed, and in the month since then, many things have deteriorated and rule of law, frankly, has suffered dramatically.</p><p>You see vandalism taking place on a weekly basis. You see actions on the part of the Security Forces which Amnesty International today denounced as signs of police out of control taking place.</p><p>It really is completely counterintuitive to a city that was once known for its record of law and order, of safety and efficiency instead, scenes like this have become very much the norm here.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Ivan Watson, thank you so much for that powerful reporting. Thank you.</p><p>As Ivan just mentioned there, Hong Kong stocks fell sharply in the session amid the escalating violence. The Hang Seng actually felt just a little more than two and a half percent, its biggest one day drop since August.</p><p>Here in the U.S., futures are pointing to a lower open for stocks across the board. All major averages are set to fall from record highs that they hit on Friday. The S&amp;P 100 is coming into its fifth straight week of gains despite new uncertainties over the U.S.-China trade negotiations.</p><p>President Trump said on Friday he has not agreed to roll back tariffs on China as Beijing demanded. The President could have more to say on tariffs on Tuesday when he delivers a speech at the Economic Club of New York.</p><p>Fed Chairman Jerome Powell testifies before Congress on the state of the economy on Wednesday and Thursday. Trading volume may be a bit lighter than usual day. Today, it is Veterans Day in the United States and bond markets are closed.</p><p>All right, let's get straight to the drivers for you. With just hours still to go, Alibaba's 2019 Singles Day has already been a record breaking success. Sales of the Chinese e-commerce giant blew past last year's $31 billion in the first 16 hours.</p><p>David Culver joins us live now from the company's headquarters. So David, another record breaking day for Alibaba. What have been some of the strategies to boost sales this year on Singles Day?</p><p>DAVID CULVER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Zain, this has been huge. As you mentioned, this is a new record already. They are at $35 billion and they're expecting that to increase because there's still a few more hours.</p><p>Now, this is one of the many high tech installations they've got out here. But let me step out here. To your point and your question about how they've been able to kind of diversify and to increase the sales year after year. It's something I asked the Chief Marketing Officer about when I sat down with him.</p><p>And he said, a lot of it has focused on really trying to create a more diverse consumer base and really tapping into different markets within Mainland China, that's been a huge focus of theirs, making those who are perhaps in rural areas even get more access to some of the high-tech technology that allows them to make purchases and do e-commerce.</p><p>But for something that's so high tech, we're looking at the top three items that were purchased are pretty basic things. Number one, pants, trousers. Number two, dress. Number three, hoodies. So that's what folks seem to be flocking to. Nonetheless, they're doing it in massive numbers.</p><p>This is also not just a China event, as it was pointed out, this is a global event and becoming increasingly so, so that's another focus for theirs. They have 78 countries that are offering up brands that have been sold throughout the day here and are continuing to do so.</p><p>[09:10:03]</p><p>CULVER: Also, we can't forget, you know, despite how fun the environment looks, the climate that we're in when it comes to the economy in particular, we were talking about the U.S. trade war. We've been talking about China's slow in GDP, the slowdown that has happened over the past two quarters reported, and it's really near the all-time low in three decades.</p><p>So in the midst of that, people are looking at this as a real indicator. You've got some 500 million users, Zain, who have been logging on today and making those purchases, they're going to be looking at that and analysts in particular will say, okay, what is the everyday Chinese citizen dealing with as far as the money is concerned? And are they comfortable enough making that spending?</p><p>So this is going to be something that's going to suggest where things are really on the front lines.</p><p>ASHER: And how are Alibaba sales compared to JD and Pinduoduo or some of its other competitors?</p><p>CULVER: When you look at the market, Zain, as you mentioned, those other e-commerce sites are big, but Alibaba has the huge chunk. And really while Singles Day is being used by several different e-commerce sites and different retailers as well, Alibaba is the one that kind of turned it into the extravaganza that it's become. I mean, they market this as a festival, so they no longer even consider this to be a campaign or promotional campaign.</p><p>They feel like it's just engaged the Chinese populace to a point that it's become so massive, but they are certainly seen the major chunk here and then that's expected to increase going forward.</p><p>But it's also worth noting, they position themselves as an e-commerce site, so they're not in their minds retailers because they're simply connecting the retailers with the consumers and it's something they're hoping to do in many different ways and allowing retailers even to brand themselves on Alibaba's many platforms.</p><p>ASHER: All right, David Culver live for us there. Thank you so much. All right, a major milestone has been passed for Saudi Aramco, the oil giant releasing fresh details for what could be the largest IPO in history.</p><p>It's still not saying exactly how much of the company is going on the bloc. John Defterios is live for us in Abu Dhabi. So, John, just walk us through what was in the perspective, excuse me, for Saudi Aramco. What are their plans for their IPO?</p><p>JOHN DEFTERIOS, CNN BUSINESS EMERGING MARKETS EDITOR: What's interesting Zain, in terms of context, Aramco is the talk of the town here in Abu Dhabi in a huge oil and gas conference, but the major players from Aramco are now here. The CEO, the Chairman or the Minister of Energy, all hands on deck to make sure this goes smoothly.</p><p>We do know now though, the details are coming out, that retail investors will get up to a half a percent to make their choice and this is something of national pride there. It is going viral on social media back in Riyadh and in Jeddah and in the eastern province, where Aramco is. They have between November 17th and November 28th to make the choice here. Institutional investors up until December 4th.</p><p>On the opening session here at ADIPEC in Abu Dhabi, I asked the former Secretary of State of the United States, Condoleezza Rice, who knows Saudi Arabia very well, is this is a sign of transparency going forward for the Kingdom in a company that was secretive for decades. Here's her answer.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>CONDOLEEZZA RICE, FORMER U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE: In speaking with the Saudi leaders, as I've done over the last several years, as they prepared for this, they understand the importance of transparency. They understand the importance of standards that are indeed global standards.</p><p>The UAE has led in many ways in the Middle East in doing this and I think this can only be a good thing for global markets. It can only be a good thing for energy supply, and I must say that as we look to how to think about energy mix, because that really is going to be the question, how can you get economic growth, energy mix and environmental sustainability all together?</p><p>Having Saudi Aramco as a part of that conversation, I think is going to be very important.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Condoleezza Rice, the former Secretary of State, also, what many people don't talk about, Zain, is that they're fighting the forces of Wall Street.</p><p>The market cap of oil and gas companies in the last five years as part of the S&amp;P 500 has been cut in half, as many people don't want to hold these big oil giants anymore.</p><p>At the same time, though, I think that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia is suggesting they need to get it done. He originally brought up the idea three years ago in 2016, so even if it's smaller than expected, it is expected to go out by the end of 19 even if it's less than two percent; they are still targeting a higher valuation, and I think they'd like to beat Alibaba in that revenue raising of $25 billion. Back to you.</p><p>ASHER: All right. John Defterios live for us there. Thank you so much. Okay. So these are the stories making headlines around the world right now.</p><p>Former Bolivian President Evo Morales is calling on opposition leaders to quote, \"pacify\" Bolivia after a wave of protests led him to resign on Sunday.</p><p>[09:15:06]</p><p>ASHER: Mr. Morales has blamed what he calls a coup attack for encouraging the violent protest. Patrick Oppmann joins us live now.</p><p>So Patrick, Evo Morales is calling this a coup. His opponents are saying good riddance to a man who they believe had zero respect for democracy. I mean, just walk us through what exactly is going to happen next.</p><p>PATRICK OPPMANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And it is still very unstable situation in Bolivia, Evo Morales, tweeting just a little while ago that his home in Cochabamba, which is really the stronghold for his support was sacked overnight, and there's actually videos of people walking around in and out of his house that has been clearly broken into. So again, just one stunning development after another.</p><p>This has been brewing for weeks now ever since the opposition in Bolivia accused Evo Morales of stealing election, of rigging the vote that would allow him to have a fourth term.</p><p>And yesterday, a report from the Organization of American States laid out in very clear detail that there was some serious voting irregularities and that somebody, most likely supporters of Evo Morales may have tried to rig the election so he would win on the first go around, which would have prevented him from having a runoff.</p><p>But it has completely backfired. Protests over the last several weeks, a couple of them were violent, and then over the weekend, we started seeing police join in with the protesters, and then by Sunday, when the military said that not only would they go out and quell the protest, but then it was time for Evo Morales to leave. That was really the clearest sign yet that his days were numbered. And by yesterday afternoon, he had in fact resigned.</p><p>We do not know who is in charge of the country at this moment because official after official who were next to the line of succession have also resigned.</p><p>Clearly, it's a priority to get somebody in as the role of Acting President because the country at this point does not seem to have one and to figure out when new elections will be held because as one of his last acts, President Evo Morales ordered there will be new elections, possibly hoping that would quiet down these protests. It did not work. He was forced out. And he says he will not seek asylum abroad and that he is staying in Bolivia. But he also says that he is fearful that he could be arrested -- Zain.</p><p>ASHER: So what will the power vacuum mean for peace and security in the country?</p><p>OPPMANN: Well, it's still a situation that could go bad at any moment because Evo Morales was popular over the years and he did help the impoverished in this country more than anybody ever had before.</p><p>He is the first President from the indigenous community which is a sizable part of the country. So he has the support and his supporters must be seething right now. Certainly, other leaders in the region, in Cuba and Venezuela, here in Mexico are -- were trying to prop him up at the end, so it's a divided continent. It's a divided country.</p><p>And he said he stepped down to avoid further bloodshed. We'll just have to see if by leaving power, he was able to accomplish that. Because on one side, you have the opposition saying that an election was stolen, and that democracy was not respected.</p><p>And then on the other side, you have people that say that he was forced off by the military and that the country is kind of tottering right now. The democracy there is in real danger until we get in civilian leadership back in power there and new elections are called. It's really anyone's guess how this is going to play out.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Patrick Oppmann live for us. Thank you so much.</p><p>In the U.K., Brexit Party leader, Nigel Farage has just given a major boost to Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Farage saying his party will not contest 317 seats held by Mr. Johnson's Conservative Party in the upcoming general election.</p><p>In Southeastern Australia, firefighters are battling more than 70 bushfires in New South Wales alone. A seven-day state of emergency has been declared and the Fire Service issued a catastrophic threat warning for the Greater Sydney Area as the flames march closer. Officials say at least three people have died and more than 100 homes have been destroyed.</p><p>All right, still to come here on FIRST MOVE, can a credit card be sexist? U.S. regulators aren't the only ones looking into the Apple card, even Apple's co-founder says that he thinks that something is very, very wrong.</p><p>And stacks of snacks. Mondelez CEO tells us appetites and profits are on the rise. That's next.</p><p>[09:22:50]</p><p>ASHER: Welcome back to FIRST MOVE. U.S. stocks are on track for a weak open on this Veterans Day here in the United States. Dow futures pointing to lower open, down already about 110 points or so. Stock market is set open about eight minutes from now.</p><p>It is Veterans Day here in the U.S. Stocks are set to pull back from the repeated record highs they set last week. Traders note that U.S. stocks are already at their richest valuations in almost two years on the hopes that that the economy will turn a quarter if trade tensions fade.</p><p>Dryden Pence joins us live now. He is the Chief Investment Officer at Pence Wealth Management. He joins us live. So Dryden, thank you so much for being with us on this Veterans Day. Certainly, an honor to have you with us. Thank you so much for your service.</p><p>So just walk us through the journey that stocks have been on from last week to this week. Obviously last week, we saw multiple record highs. This week, it seems like we're having a bit of a lower open already on this Monday.</p><p>DRYDEN PENCE, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PENCE WEALTH MANAGEMENT: Well, it's been the pattern over the last several times, we hit these record highs and then everybody kind of takes a breather, takes a look at it, and you begin to see the stocks come back.</p><p>And it's not uncommon over the last several cycles for us to see even as much as a five to ten percent pullback after a record high and then it straightens out and then recovers thereafter.</p><p>So, you know, pulling back from here is not necessarily unexpected, but a lot of those things that have created some headline are beginning to abate.</p><p>ASHER: What would you say were the major headwinds though on the horizon just in terms of risk to the market in the short term?</p><p>PENCE: Sure, well, you know, we did have the Fed as a headwind. That's kind of off the table. We had Brexit as a headwind, that's beginning to abate some. And then we have the China trade tensions, which kind of is a day-to-day. One day you hear it's going to be fine; the next day, it's not. Then you have a schedule.</p><p>So we have those things and then later on this month, you still have a couple of issues. You do have a Fed meeting coming up in December, but then in mid-November, we're going to have the tariff situation that the President is going to have to make some decision about on auto tariffs.</p><p>So those are some things that could give rise to headline activity that could create one of these bumps in the road or stimulate some of this volatility that we've typically seen after a recent high.</p><p>So those are the things to watch out more. More headline driven than actual economy driven. We're beginning to see some of these things level out, although the global economy still looks like it's slowing down.</p><p>[09:25:29]</p><p>ASHER: In terms of another interest rate cut, I mean, almost everybody believes that probably interest rates will stay the same in December, but when do you anticipate the next cut will be next year?</p><p>PENCE: I actually think that next year, being a Fed governor is going to be a fairly boring job. I think that they do have it about right. They certainly raised twice last year. They shouldn't have. They've had to pull those out. Now, they've pulled a third one out to kind of cover this trade tension that we have.</p><p>And I think the Fed says they feel like they've got it about right, barring any major changes in the economy. And I kind of take them at their word on that. I think we'll probably level for a while.</p><p>I mean, the thing is, expectations have changed. Feds raise interest rates, it changes human behavior, and we found that a four percent rate on a mortgage is about where human behavior changes, about the rates where they are right now of where people continue to buy things, where they don't get spooked from too high of interest rates, and that has leveled off.</p><p>I mean, the Fed has found the right level at this point where behavior matches up where you don't have these major changes or a reduction in demand.</p><p>So consumers change their behavior with a much lower interest rate now than they did 20 years ago. I think the Fed got it wrong about that. Now, they understand that with half the population below the age of 45, I think that they've recognized that people's behavior changes with a much lower interest rate and I think they found -- they found their path and it is right about here.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Dryden Pence, we have to leave it there. Thank you so much. Appreciate it.</p><p>Okay, so you are watching FIRST MOVE. The market open after this short break in just three minutes.</p><p>[09:30:14]</p><p>ASHER: The opening bell has just rung here on this Monday, November 11 at the New York Stock Exchange. It is Veterans Day. You see members of the military up on the podium there.</p><p>As expected, though, we do have a lower start to the trading week here on Wall Street as all the major averages are pulling back from Friday's all- time closing highs.</p><p>We are already down about 130 points on the Dow. Investors are clearly hoping to get some clarity on the U.S.-China trade this week. President Trump is delivering a speech at the Economic Club here in New York tomorrow. He must also decide by Wednesday whether to impose tariffs on European auto imports.</p><p>European stocks are pulling back this session as well. U.K. stocks are performing the worst. New numbers show the British economy avoiding recession in the third quarter. That said, economic growth was the weakest in a decade.</p><p>And looking at the Global Movers, we are watching Alibaba and JD.com, both Chinese online giants celebrating blockbuster sales for Singles Day. It is the world's busiest, biggest online shopping day worth than Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined.</p><p>Also shares of Walgreens Boots are on the rise. Reports say buyout firm, KKR, has actually approached the drugstore giant to discuss taking the company private. If that happens, it could be one of the biggest ever leveraged buyouts.</p><p>And Deutsche Bank stock is down in Frankfurt. It's been meeting British financial regulators to explain why its internal systems are having problems processing high-value payments.</p><p>A New York regulator is looking at the allegations that Goldman SachsApple card is sexist. The flurry of accusations of gender buyers in the card's algorithms erupted last week with one such criticism coming from Apple co- founder Steve Wozniak.</p><p>Let's bring in Clare Sebastian who joins us live now. So Clare, Steve Wozniak is basically saying that his wife was given a lower credit limit on the card despite the fact that they share financial assets. Just walk us through how something like that could possibly happen without it being a clear case of sexism.</p><p>CLARE SEBASTIAN, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: Yes, Zain, this has really escalated in the past few days. It didn't actually start with Steve Wozniak, it started with another tech entrepreneur called David Heinemeier Hansson.</p><p>He tweeted last Thursday, we think we can show you that tweet, \"The Apple card is such a (explorative) sexist program. My wife and I filed joint tax returns, live in a community property state and have been married for a long time. Yet, Apple's black box algorithm think I deserve 20 times the credit limit. She does no appeals work.\"</p><p>So he goes on to say, after this now viral tweet that he spoke to Apple representative who implied it was the algorithm. They then upped his wife's credit limit by way of consolation. He wasn't happy with that because he said, it didn't get to the root of the problem.</p><p>And meanwhile, as you say, Steve Wozniak, the Apple co-founder chimed in, let's have a look at his tweet. He said, in a reply, \"The same thing happened to us, I got 10 times the credit limit. We have no separate bank or credit card accounts or any separate assets. Hard to get a human for a correction, though. It's big tech in 2019.\"</p><p>So damning comments that from the co-founder of Apple. Now Apple have referred questions on this to Goldman Sachs who are the credit card issuer and Goldman Sachs, they put out a statement late last night. Let's have a look at that. They say, \"As with any other individual credit card, your application is evaluated independently. We look at an individual's income and an individual's credit worthiness which includes factors like personal credit scores, how much debt you have, and how that debt has been managed.\"</p><p>They say crucially, \"Based on these factors, it is possible for two family members to receive significantly different credit decisions. In all cases, we have not and will not make decisions based on factors like gender.\"</p><p>But meanwhile, Zain, the New York Financial Services Department has come in and said, they are investigating this. They say that any discrimination by any financial product is banned by the law.</p><p>So this is a very new product, the Apple Card. It only launched in August and already hitting a fairly big PR problem, if not a structural problem.</p><p>ASHER: So, given that regulators are investigating, how much trouble could Goldman Sachs be in if it is determined that somehow the algorithm -- obviously, they are denying it, but the algorithm could be discriminating based on gender?</p><p>SEBASTIAN: Right, so I mean, it's difficult to know exactly how much the sanctions on this are. I mean, I've reached out to them to find out what they are. I think usually they do sanction every violation, so it could get potentially expensive.</p><p>But of course, Goldman coming out and defending themselves saying that we do not discriminate on the basis of gender and they are, you know, heavily invested in this. Goldman has recently started branching out into consumer finance.</p><p>This is a big high profile product. Not to mention of course, for Apple which is crucial for its business that they really increase their services portion of it of which Apple Pay is a big part.</p><p>So both of these companies are going to be really looking to defend this. So a big problem for both businesses.</p><p>[09:35:25]</p><p>ASHER: Clare Sebastian live for us there. Thank you so much. All right. All right. Up next here on FIRST MOVE, Singles Day brings record sales to Alibaba as Chinese consumers discount the trade war balloon. That's next.</p><p>ASHER: Alibaba's Singles Day has broken records and it is not even over yet. A couple more hours to go. The e-commerce giant smashed last year's $31 billion sales record 16 hours into the day. The 24-hour shopping holiday ends in just over an hour.</p><p>This year, Singles Day is good news for Alibaba, which is under pressure from China's slowing economy and the trade war with the United States.</p><p>Joining me live now is Shehzad Qazi, Managing Director at China Beige Book. Thank you so much for being with us.</p><p>SHEHZAD QAZI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, CHINA BEIGE BOOK: Glad to be here, thanks.</p><p>ASHER: So given that the Chinese consumer isn't necessarily as robust as it should be, how much of a surprise is Alibaba's record breaking results there?</p><p>QAZI: Yes, I wouldn't say it's much of a surprise really. Alibaba has been doing quite phenomenal every year for Singles Day. We've seen record breaking sales in the past, but I think Alibaba is not the Chinese economy. We need to pull back and look at the larger context.</p><p>ASHER: It's an outlier.</p><p>QAZI: It's absolutely an outlier. You know, it also has people from other countries buying up, so it's not just domestic Chinese consumption, either. There's a lot of discounting that takes place. So how much of that shows up in the bottom line? All those are questions that we need to look at.</p><p>But more importantly, all the data that's come out has consistently shown that Chinese demand is, you know, sort of very modest, even tepid.</p><p>In the third quarter of this year, China Beige Book data that came out, you know, we saw overall within the economy, we saw some of the weakest numbers this year that we've recorded.</p><p>[09:40:10]</p><p>QAZI: All the official data that's been coming out in recent weeks sort of continuously emphasized that the economy as a whole is actually weak. You know, PMIs are in contraction territory for half a year now. Imports have been falling for about half a year. Exports are contracting, I think four months in a row, something like that.</p><p>The latest inflation data that's come out again, similarly shows factories are struggling. But even if you looked at consumer prices, they're quite modest.</p><p>ASHER: And just in terms of the effect of the U.S. trade war with China on the Chinese economy, just every time, even with the -- you know, here in the U.S., every time the market sort of feel as though we are approaching a deal and things are moving on nicely, we get a tweet or a comment from the President that sets us back just a little bit.</p><p>QAZI: Yes.</p><p>ASHER: Walk us through that.</p><p>QAZI: Yes, absolutely. Both sides. This is a negotiation, right? And then one of the things they do in a negotiation naturally is you posture a little bit. So every time both sides, you know, there's --you put on sort of just grand posture and say, no, we're not willing to concede. Of course, there's going to be a big market reaction.</p><p>Also the markets are really just looking for a deal, some kind of a deal. They don't really, I think care what the deal actually really even entails to a large extent.</p><p>In terms of some of the outlying bigger structural issues, right now, everybody is hoping and wishing that the December tariffs are gone. I think we know that for a fact more or less. The Chinese have been told that there is going to be a punt on December tariffs.</p><p>The big question is, of course, the September tariffs.</p><p>ASHER: Right?</p><p>QAZI: What happens with that? That's where there's a lot of uncertainty. Now, one thing that we've been able to communicate out to our clients et cetera is, of course that the September tariffs -- you know, there is more or less consensus within the organization.</p><p>The hawks are fine with the September tariffs being rolled back. There's just one person standing in the middle of that or in the way of that and that would be the President himself who has not yet made that decision on whether or not he wants to roll back the September tariffs and give that into the Chinese.</p><p>ASHER: And then just in terms of concessions that China is going to have to offer for its part in exchange for these tariffs being rolled gold back and how much U.S. agricultural output are they going to have to buy et cetera?</p><p>QAZI: Yes, so one interesting thing here is that the President himself, he is very much interested in the Ag purchases, right? He wants to make sure that the farmers feel some kind of -- are taken care of or they feel like they are taken care of. He is also looking for LNG purchases and potentially having an energy deal with China.</p><p>The larger concern is that this deal, the mini deal, the interim deal should never be made to look like it is essentially American -- the American side rolling back tariffs in exchange for Ag purchases only.</p><p>If that's the case, I think the President is going to have a lot of problems when he hits the election trail next year because it's going to look like a very weaker deal that he struck.</p><p>So what the -- you know, what the Chinese side now is looking to do is potentially going back to the May draft, maybe making some IP concessions on top of that. There has been recently some parts of market access, et cetera, intellectual property -- you know, protecting intellectual property, and so forth. So those are some of the deal -- so some of the things that are be worked out right now.</p><p>ASHER: So some say that, you know, a trade deal has been more or less baked into the market at this point. But really the fact that it's going to be done in phases, the fact that we're getting a piecemeal trade deal signals to a certain extent, at least to me that there's always going to be room for one side to change their mind or pull back.</p><p>QAZI: Oh, yes, absolutely. I mean, first of all, there was an assumption that there was going to be a deal this month, now, first of all, that's not -- that's not in itself a sure shot thing in any event.</p><p>And absolutely, I mean, this thing may very well play out to the last minute. I think one of the things that the President would like to do is hold back on some of the bigger concessions until he is in the room with President Xi Jinping himself. You know, he wants to make that -- make the final deal himself.</p><p>I think he is going to get it and he wants to also get a big market splash out of it, I'm sure. He cares about those things. So yes, there's going to be likely uncertainty until the very end and markets are probably going to remain jittery until the two of them get in the same room.</p><p>Now, of course, the question is, can they agree on enough things beforehand to even get the two men in the same room? Because this thing needs to be big enough ...</p><p>ASHER: Right, right.</p><p>QAZI: ... to justify the Presidents coming together.</p><p>ASHER: All right, Shehzad Qazi, thank you so much.</p><p>QAZI: Thanks.</p><p>ASHER: Appreciate it. As President Trump rejects reports that he is about to roll back tariffs on China, German giant Siemens says the trade war is its single biggest problem.</p><p>The CEO, Joe Kaeser told John Defterios the world is watching and he hopes the two governments will find a way out. Take a listen.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOE KAESER, CEO, SIEMENS: I think the single biggest issue we have is still the ongoing trade war between China and the United States. Everybody is looking because the number one and number two in the world are in disarray. People wait and wonder what the hell is going on. That could actually get out kick off, quite a big rally because people have not been investing.</p><p>They are actually on the sideline until the dust would be settling. So, actually we are optimistic that this could actually in the second half of 2020, it could actually be quite productive.</p><p>[09:45:05]</p><p>DEFTERIOS: It is interesting you say that. The Trump administration would make a big miscalculation with a country that has $3 trillion of reserves, and still growing five and a half to six percent. They're not rushing to a deal.</p><p>KAESER: Well, let me put it this way five or six percent in China would be looking great for Europe, but it's not looking great for China. I have to say that, there's got to be an understanding on how trade is going to happen in the future.</p><p>By not saying that, well, look, if you look at energy here, oil and gas, 4.0. We look at the Internet of Things, all that great stuff, which technology is actually helping us to achieve. And all the three Industrial Revolutions have brought out -- people out of poverty, have been making a better world.</p><p>Now, we are at 4.0 forging a solution, which is Internet of Things. Everything is connected. The whole world is supposed to be connected, so how can it be all connected, you know if people go back into nationalism and protectionism?</p><p>DEFTERIOS: Is that what you're banking on? You think they can have a major breakthrough?</p><p>KAESER: I do think at the end of the day, they will find a way to cooperate. They are the number one and number two in the world, so everybody is watching this. So I am sure they are going to get something done.</p><p>DEFTERIOS: In Davos two years ago, you sat next to President Trump at the dinner. How much of a trouble is it this impeachment hearing do you think on sentiment in the United States and what happens to him in your view?</p><p>KAESER: Well, look, that's a matter of the American people. You know, they need to decide how they want to design the leadership. We work with every government which is being elected, which is in touch. Some are a bit more challenging, some are a bit less, but we work with everybody, and so let's take it from there.</p><p>(END VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>ASHER: All right, coming up, Adidas powers off its robots in Germany and the U.S. is saying it's time for high tech manufacturing in Asia.

I mean, somebody is dead.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Well, it's a serious mistake. We've made mistakes too, right, with self-driving, and we stopped driving and we're recovering from that mistake.</p><p>So I think that people make mistakes. It doesn't mean that they can never be forgiven. I think they've taken it seriously.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The CIA didn't suggest that they made a mistake and that was an oversight. Like with self-driving, that was basically a bad sensor, correct?</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: Yes.</p><p>UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was -- the CIA suggested that the Crown Prince had a role in ordering an assassination. It's a different thing. You guys didn't intentionally run somebody over.</p><p>KHOSROWSHAHI: I didn't read that part of the CIA report. You're obviously deeper in it. But I think from a Saudi perspective, they're just like any other shareholder, right? It's we -- now we're a public company, anyone can invest in our company if they choose to do so.

The global food conglomerate, Mondelez is raising its 2019 sales forecast with an increased demand for snacks, especially in emerging markets.</p><p>Mondelez CEO, Dirk Van de Put sat down with Alison Kosik to talk about global snacking trends and the uncertainty surrounding Brexit and trade.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)</p><p>DIRK VAN DE PUT, CEO, MONDELEZ: First of all, snacking is growing today of the adults in the world. Most of them now eat more snacks than they eat full meals. And so that's an important consideration.</p><p>There's a number of interesting findings. Women snack more than men, millennials and Generation Z's snack a lot more than the older generations. People in developing countries snack more. So snacking is on the rise and it's really a big trend.</p><p>The second big finding is that our relationship to food is changing. Foods 30 years ago was about nutrition, it was about hunger. Now, the relationship to health is becoming clearer and clearer for every consumer and they take that into consideration if they eat.</p><p>But it's also about emotional mental wellness. It's about taking a break, about relaxing, re-energizing. And the last one, which I think we've seen recently is about your identity. It's who you are. What you eat is a representation of who you are. If you're a parent, what you give your kids as snack is very important.</p><p>Now that leads me to the third big consideration which is snacking is a bit more than just eating. It is about reconnecting to your roots.</p><p>ALISON KOSIK, CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT: How much of a challenge is that for you and how maybe are you thinking about expanding Mondelez's product line knowing that many consumers want the fresh over what's in the box or the bag?</p><p>VAN DE PUT: Yes, obviously we are studying that and we have projects to go into that direction. I would say packaged snacks are growing quite a lot, too because there's the portability, there's the freshness. But yes, fresh snacking is a clear trend also.</p><p>KOSIK: You've really taken this global view about snacking and realizing that snacking is kind of three dimensional, isn't it? And that there are regional tastes. How has Mondelez used that knowledge?</p><p>VAN DE PUT: Well, we adapt our product range to the different regions of the world. We have an assortment of brands, global brands, Oreo, Milka, Cadbury and we have local brands, Cote d'Or within Belgium or LU in France, and as we connect to the local consumers, we understand better what they like, what they don't like? Which brands do they prefer?</p><p>So we use that information and we also use the flavors. For instance, the Oreo flavors in China are completely different from Oreo flavors in the U.S. because Chinese palate is completely different.</p><p>KOSIK: And let's talk tariffs for a minute. How has trade tariffs impacted your business? And despite, you know, signs of these trade tensions ramping down, are you still factoring in higher costs because of these tariffs?</p><p>VAN DE PUT: In our case, we are largely local producers in the big countries around the world, so tariffs, not necessarily affect us in a big way. But in January where our head was largely around Brexit and if Brexit would come, and the U.K. government was thinking about imposing tariffs, some of what we sell in the U.K. is imported from Europe. So that was what was going through our head.</p><p>In the meantime, it does look like they are not really planning for that. And so tariffs for us, largely because we have local factories around the world don't affect us that much.</p><p>[09:55:07]</p><p>KOSIK: So with Brexit kind of in a holding pattern, are you still kind of building additional inventory, stockpiling and packaging ingredients? Are you still doing that?</p><p>VAN DE PUT: Again, it's the third time we're going to do it now for the potential January Brexit date, yes, yes.</p><p>KOSIK: So how does that affect your business though, to continue in this uncertain pattern?</p><p>VAN DE PUT: Well, each time Brexit might be coming, and the borders might become a problem. Since we ship from the mainland, not everything, but part of what we sell in the U.K., in advance which we ship more products in the U.K., more raw materials in the U.K. We contract more trucks, so that's an extra cost for us. And then as Brexit doesn't come, we ease that out again.</p><p>Then there was the second period of Brexit so we did that again. Now with January, so we'll do it again in December and January. So it's an extra cost to our business. It is an extra complexity. It makes our people walk away from the day-to-day job having to do special things.

It is Monday, November 11th 2019, Veteran's Day. We begin with a special thank you and salute to our nation's veterans and all who serve the nation in uniform all around the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In New York City today, the commander-in-chief spoke at the city's Veteran's Day parade becoming the first president to do so. President Trump honored those who've served the nation saying the glory of their deeds only grows greater with time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In other news tonight, it has been 48 days since the Radical Dems began their secret so-called hearings behind closed doors as they continue to try to construct their partisan assault in the constitution and the president of the United States.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Intel Committee Chairman, Adam Schiff, continues to deny fair and equitable participation of the republican members of Congress and has denied the Republicans' call to bring in their own witnesses this week. The Radical Dems and their co-conspirators, the deep state and the national leftist media have attacked President Trump unrelentingly since his election in 2016.</p><p>This week the Republican Party appears united behind the president and his public support has been unwavering in opposition to the subversive and corrosive left.</p><p>For the latest, we go to Fox Chief White House Correspondent, John Roberts.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>JOHN ROBERTS, FOX CHIEF WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: President Trump made history today, the first U.S. President to attend the New York City Veteran's Day parade.</p><p>DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: You are America's greatest living heroes.</p><p>ROBERTS: He will spend one more night in New York in a speech to the economic club tomorrow before returning to Washington for the first public hearing in the impeachment inquiry.</p><p>The latest battle is over who Republicans can call as witnesses. Devin Nunes, the ranking member of the intelligence committee seeking approval from more than nine witnesses including the whistleblower and anyone he or she got the information from.</p><p>Hunter Biden, Nelly Ohr, a contractor for opposition research firm Fusion GPS. Tim Morrison, the former senior Europe and Russia expert at NSC and Kurt Volker. They want him on the panel with Bill Taylor and George Kent, Wednesday.</p><p>It's likely that at least two of those witnesses will be vetoed by Chairman Adam Schiff. In a letter to Devin Nunez, Schiff saying that having the whistleblower testify would be quote, \"Redundant and unnecessary.\"</p><p>He also said he has no interest in quote, \"Sham investigations of the Bidens.\" One witness that Democrats may call, Lev Parnas an associate of Rudy Giuliani's who's charged with campaign finance violations.</p><p>Fox News confirms that Parnas is prepared to tell Congress that all the way back in May, he told Ukrainian officials that in less than new government there opened an investigation to Joe and Hunter Biden, Vice President Mike Pence would not attend President Zelensky swearing in and USAID would be frozen.</p><p>What Parnas has apparently prepared to testify runs counter to everything the president Rudy Giuliani and Ukrainian officials have said.</p><p>Parnas has been subpoenaed by the House Committees for documents and testimony and told he has been producing the documents we may soon see what he has to say. Lou?</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>ROBERTS: John. Thank you very much. John Roberts from the White House. Joining us tonight award-winning Investigative Reporter, Fox Business Contributor, John Solomon. John, good to see you.</p><p>JOHN SOLOMON, AWARD-WINNING INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER: Good to be with you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: The first question following John Roberts' report is what makes Lev Parnas more credible than all the others who've testified or made statements directly contradicting what he said?</p><p>SOLOMON: I did want to tell tonight, I know Lev Parnas. I used him in some of my reporting. He always seemed to be an honest broker on the ground.</p><p>Let me tell you what I think the problem is for Democrats. The hearsay witnesses opine that the president had a quid pro quo. But the witnesses who actually talked to the president can only say the president said no quid pro quo.</p><p>Only the president and those people who talked to the president really know what deal was in place. And I think that that's one of the challenges the Democrats have.</p><p>They have hearsay evidence that contradicts the actual first-hand evidence of people who talk to the president. I think there's going to be a lot more new information coming out.</p><p>Specifically what other things the president might have been hearing from the intelligence community that influences thinking on Ukraine. Keep an eye on that, I think that's going to be a big development over the next week.</p><p>DOBBS: As I watch what is unfolding in Washington, listening to the testimony, reading the testimony as some of it is being released even now.</p><p>I don't see the problem here. And I'm trying to be independent and subjective as possible. I just do not understand if the president said I want with this investigation, I want to understand what the origins -- we have the Justice Department for crying out loud, investigating the origins of the 2016 assault on this president.</p><p>SOLOMON: Of course.</p><p>DOBBS: What in the world is the problem here?</p><p>SOLOMON: Yeah, and I think there's going to be a bigger issue that emerges here Lou, and that is what was the president's definition of corruption.</p><p>The media and the Democrats want to focus it on Biden in the 2016 election. I suspect that the president was getting in these intelligence briefings a much broader look at corruption and the more specifically who the new president was associated with.</p><p>President Zelensky have these relationships as everyone does with oligarchs and business people.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>SOLOMON: I would not be surprised if the president's briefings in the May June, July timeframe give a much broader picture they once being discussed in this very narrow political exercise that the Democrats are not carrying out in Congress.</p><p>I think when we find out what the president's real basis for understanding why he was making these requests when that becomes public, I think we're going to have a different picture, much like we got when we learn the real story on Russia.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, the real story, it is the story is it? Speaking of the real story, the Solomon report in whi8ch you're saying the Obama administration tried in 2016 to partner with Burisma while Hunter Biden was sitting on their board apparently the administration thought that that might pose something called corruption concerns.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yeah, absolutely. You know, one of the most interesting parts of the impeachment testimony that the Democrats and media aren't focusing on is just how concerned members of the state department in the NEC and others were concerned about Joe Biden and Hunter Biden's relationship with Burisma.</p><p>They saw conflict of interest in 2015. They were concerned when the State Department tried to do a co-project or a joint project with Burisma through Hunter Biden and Devon Archer. And they actually put a stop to it because of the corruption allegations that's surrounded that company.</p><p>This isn't an event that Rudy Giuliani or I or anyone else invented, the Democrats in 15 and 16 had their concerns long before I reported it. Rudy Giuliani did his research. That's the part that's missing from this narrative and Joe Biden seems to be the only person that doesn't see a problem with what went on between him and Hunter Biden and Burisma.</p><p>DOBBS: The witnesses who would discuss exactly that issue.</p><p>SOLOMON: That's right.</p><p>DOBBS: The New York Times reporting yesterday by vice president Biden concerned about their Burisma job. We're not saying a broad effort on the part of a left-wing national medial to deal with the story and to give that some focus as you were talking about the broader truth that's going to be revealed. They're only grudgingly touching the margins of this story right now.</p><p>SOLOMON: Yeah. You know there were some ABC News has done a good job. I think the Washington Post from time to time speak up a few things in New York times, a couple of times.</p><p>There is a very clear narrative, the documents I saw it enforce the release of last week at the State Department clearly show that Hunter Biden's company was lobbying the State Department to help make the corruption allegations go away in Ukraine right the beginning of the 2016 electi0n.</p><p>And when they approached that State Department, they invoked Hunter Biden's name as the reason why they needed help. That is the sort of conflict of interest that ethics laws in Washington were created to avoid and I think as we dig in further in the next couple of months, I'm going to give another trench of documents from the court we order really soon.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>SOLOMON: I think we're going to learn a lot more about what those State Department bureaucrats, NEC bureaucrats were doing in the middle of the 2016 election to address this Burisma crisis that Joe Biden was facing.</p><p>DOBBS: I want to touch on another topic here if we may in which you're suggesting the president has a tremendous strategic opportunity here. His Berlin wall moment as you style it.</p><p>SOLOMON: Right. Yeah, you know all this distraction with impeachment, Russia collusion, all of the things we've been talking about has blinded the media with some of the developments going on in the Middle East.</p><p>And I think right now, this president has set in motion a dynamic that we have not seen in certainly my lifetime in the Middle East. We are seeing regional partners, I'm talking his frenemies, having conversations that they haven't had in a long time, trying to broker settlements beneath of United States that make this region more stable.</p><p>And I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that Trump simultaneously pulled out the troops and managed to get al-Baghdadi, showing that we can strong even while we pursue a piece.</p><p>I think there's a big story being missed in the Middle East. I think president trump has put together a unique opportunity to create peace in the Middle East and I think Donald Trump has put into motion a very unique opportunity.</p><p>I'll be at fragile, a unique opportunity to create peace in the Middle East.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, I think that the fact of the matter is the national leftist media again is only grudgingly beginning to look at the reality that's emerging from a decision that once again this president is, if you will, disrupted the orthodox ANC said of course which seems to be as usual a course that has tremendous benefits beyond what the orthodoxy ever imagined.</p><p>SOLOMON: I had a democratic senator when I first came to Washington in 1990, a guy name Bill Proxmire very wise man and he said something that's always stuck in the back of my head, if you're going to be a disrupter, you're going to ruffle feathers and sometimes you got to wait for the feathers to clear before you see the truth of what happened.</p><p>I think that's a lot of Donald Trump's president. We're just beginning to see the things he have done because of disruption.</p><p>DOBBS: Right. And just because that Donald Trump, we're seeing a lot of benefits across foreign policy, domestic policy, and economic policy without a doubt. John Solomon as always, great to see you my friend.</p><p>SOLOMON: Thank you, sir. Appreciate it.</p><p>DOBBS: This broadcast has been reporting for weeks now about a senate bill that serves to accelerate the flow of Indian H-1B visas into the United States, directly, directly competing with U.S. workers with lower wages.</p><p>We're now learning that the chief sponsor of that legislation in the senate, Senator Mike Lee, is refusing to hold a public hearing on the bill. Senator Dick Durbin who has a competing bill says Lee won't take up a broader debate on an alternate proposal put forward by Democrats or on his own Senate Bill 386, known as the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act which already passed in the House as HR-1044.</p><p>Now, talking with reporters Durbin calls Lee's refusal for open hearings and debate unusual. Let me say what I mean here and I don't mean unusual, I mean it's scurrilous. It is absolutely beneath contempt and he should be ashamed, as we detailed here before.</p><p>Senator Lee has taken in thousands of dollars in this election cycle from some of the top sponsors of H-1B visas and outsourcers including big tech firms, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon.</p><p>It is more than interesting that a report released earlier this year finds that the Salt Lake City Metro area is second, second only to Silicon Valley in the percentage of commercial leases signed by technology companies last year.</p><p>Lee has tried and failed four times to force his bill through the Senate by the device known as unanimous consent, which does not require votes of the supporting Senators of course or even the opposing Senators should there be one or two.</p><p>It is deeply concerning that Senator Lee seems to have the support of another Republican, Senator John Cornyn. He says Durbin's quote, \"Delay tactics won't work.\" A delay tactic in calling for hearings and public debate that certainly Senator Lee's bill requires before it should be allowed to pass in any form, in any senator, in my opinion should definitely give the public a chance to air their thoughts about this very important critical legislation that sets up direct competition with U.S. workers.</p><p>And I would hope that the president would go so far as to ask Senator Lee and Senator Durbin to back off their bills and for Senator McConnell to take charge of the Senate and set this up for debate if we are to have a debate about a bill that will directly set up more intense competition with U.S. workers.</p><p>It is unfair, it is unreasonable, and it is a fraud on the American worker.</p><p>Up next, the Supreme Court gears up for what could be one of the countries defining immigration court cases. We take that up and more.</p><p>Border Patrol Union President Brandon Judd joins us here. Also Nikki Haley sharing tales of subversion treachery in the White House. I wonder, did she tell the president? We'll find out. We'll take that up and more right after this quick messages, stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Another record-setting day on Wall Street, not a lot of action, but the Dow importantly up 10 points closing at its 9th record close of the year.</p><p>The S&amp;P losing 6, the NASDAQ fell 11, no records there. Volume on the big board, the volume backing up to 3.1. Billion shares and crude oil down over a half percent to just under $57 a barrel. Gold lost nearly a half percent, silver closed flat.</p><p>Boeing expected to resume deliveries of its grounded 737 max jetliners next month. It could start commercial flights as early as January.</p><p>Boeing 737 Max's have been ground since March after two deadly crashes, 346 people killed in those crashes. Boeing stock is up nearly 5 percent in after-hours trading on the news about the possibility of a January flight for the 737 Max's.</p><p>New documents revealing Southwest Airlines is continuing to fly 38 of its 737 aircraft, even though they don't have their final safety verifications.</p><p>According to the documents an FAA official recommended grounding those aircraft for lacking adequate maintenance records. The FAA has given southwest until the end of January to complete thorough inspections of those 38 jetliners.</p><p>Well, a reminder to listen to my reports three times a day coast-to- coast on the Salem Radio Network.</p><p>Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney today asked a court to decide whether he should appear before Congress to take part in the Radical Dems sham impeachment farce.</p><p>Mulvaney is trying to join a lawsuit put forth by former National Security John Bolton and his deputy Charles Kupperman who are also asking the courts to decide if they should either obey the White House directions or the subpoena of Congress.</p><p>An attorney for Bolton and Kupperman oppose the move by Mulvaney arguing their cases are different to Mulvaney's as he still works at the White House. We'll see if that is a distinction or a distinction without a difference.</p><p>Former Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley with a new book in which she reveals former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and former White House Chief of Staff John Kelly tried to recruit her to subvert President Trump and his agenda.</p><p>Haley telling CBS Tillerson and Kelly insisted they weren't subverting the President but were, quote, \"Trying to save the country.\"</p><p>Joining us, tonight former Reagan White House Political Director, Fox Business Political Analyst, Ed Rollins. Fox Business Contributor and New York Post Columnist, the Pulitzer Prize winning Michael Goodwin. Good to have you both here.</p><p>Let's start with your assessment of the Nikki Haley revelations that Tillerson and Kelly were trying to subvert the president and look for her assistance.</p><p>ED ROLLINS, FOX BUSINESS POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I don't know what assistance she could have given other than a P.R. perspective. At the end of the day, she was not a decision maker. She sits up here and basically deals with foreign nations and casts votes.</p><p>But she doesn't make the decisions on the votes. The decision is made by the president with the advising council of the sector of state. So to me, it's kind of a strange story and is kind of disturbing story.</p><p>Equally as important, what are the issues that they're arguing about? And I assume that they weren't winning their way with Trump and they weren't winning their way with Trump and the Secretary of State and the chief of staff of the White House, they're not going to win with Nikki or 20 other people in the cabinet.</p><p>The president has made up his mind what he wanted to do, that's why it should be.</p><p>MICHAEL GOODWIN, FOX BUSINESS CONTRIBUTOR: Well, I'm also reminded of the Rod Rosenstein story, the allegations that he talked about invoking the 25th amendment. I would also draw a distinction between Rex Tillerson and General Kelly.</p><p>Tillerson was well-known for going around the world and bad mouthing the president, telling the foreign leaders you don't have to listen to him, and pay no attention.</p><p>Kelly's response to Nikki Haley's book I thought was interesting because he said, you know if by subverting, you mean trying to set up a process where the president heard all sides and we made methodical decisions, I plead guilty.</p><p>So, there seem to be very different versions of what they were proposing to her. And as Ed said there's something strange about it.</p><p>DOBBS: Let's put up the Kelly response if we may so that everyone can see this. He said if by resistance and stalling she means putting a staff process in place to ensure the president knew all the pros and cons of what policy decision he might be contemplating so he could make an informed decision than guilty as charged.\"</p><p>That doesn't seem here regular, but on the other hand, it could be interpreted a lot of ways.</p><p>ROLLINS: It would have been better if none of this has been said and her book publicly -- what Kelly did is Kelly came into a White House in somewhat disarray. Both men and in previous didn't - had never been in government then didn't quite understand how to set it up.</p><p>Kelly obviously did, Kelly understood orderly processes because of his long career in the military and having been the cabinet secretary and I don't think he did anything in those against the president. He did something to basically the president system work better.</p><p>DOBBS: Personally, I think it seems to me that the assessment of a chaos was more of a, if you will, an establishment and left wing and RINO view of the White House at that point.</p><p>And I think that this president by the way has functioned very well with a lean staff. He is the decision maker, the fed doesn't sound too much like George W. Bush.</p><p>(LAUGHTER)</p><p>GOODWIN: The decider.</p><p>DOBBS: With the decider in chief here. But it is true, he has a remarkable adroit group of people around him right now.</p><p>ROLLINS: He basically knows what he wants to do, and the reality is he's the one that got the votes, he's the one that gets to do it.</p><p>DOBBS: And now we've got to turn to Lindsey Graham who said this, if we can put this up, we got Lindsey Graham on the importance of the whistleblower to the so-called this impeachment farce and its process.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>SEN. LINDSEY GRAHAM, (R-SC): It's impossible to bring this case forward in my view fairly without us knowing who whistleblower is and having a chance to cross-examine them about any biases they may have.</p><p>So, if they don't call the whistleblower in the House, this thing is dead on arrival in the Senate.</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Michael?</p><p>GOODWIN: Well, it should be dead on arrival but I don't know that Lindsey Graham is going to be able to make that call alone. I assume there will be some summary dismissal motion made on the floor by a Senate Republican and if you can get 50 vote for it, then it would be dead on arrival.</p><p>But at this point, we only know this is Lindsey Graham talking. We don't know if its Mitch McConnell is even behind this?</p><p>DOBBS: But he's talking sense?</p><p>GOODWIN: Oh yes.</p><p>ROLLINS: As I said on the show weeks ago, a CIA operative who was in the CIA building and not in the White House doing investigation and spy work on the president.</p><p>The first question I would ask is where did you get your information? How did you find out what was going on? He's made the charge and now they all basically want to say, well we've back the charges up, well they haven't the charges up.</p><p>What is his motives? How did he get it? How did he get his information? And if he was basically spying in those country and spying on the president of the United States, he should be fired and probably jailed.</p><p>DOBBS: Should we be saying the whistleblower's name out loud?</p><p>ROLLINS: I don't care.</p><p>GOODWIN: If we're certain, absolutely.</p><p>DOBBS: There you go. Ed Rollins, Michael Goodwin, thank you both. Appreciate it.</p><p>Up next, why does one of the Dems' sham impeachment witnesses get to keep his job in the National Security Council? Touching, isn't it? Or is it just troubling.</p><p>We take that up and more. Judicial Watch's Tom Fitton with us right after this quick break. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: RINO Congressman Will Hurd says the so-called whistleblower's identity should be protected. Hurd, though is a former CIA officer who is giving his post up in congress next year. He disagrees House Intel Ranking Member Devin Nunes' request to have the whistleblower publicly testify.</p><p>(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>REP. WILL HURD (R-TX): It's how we've treat this whistleblower will impact whistleblowers in the future. Having this whistleblower law on the books is important. It's an important checks and balance. I'm not only in the intelligence community, but our government --</p><p>(END VIDEO CLIP)</p><p>DOBBS: Well, whistleblower or is he a leaker or is he a spy? The Former CIA Officer Congressman Hurd was an undercover officer for the CIA in the Middle East and South Asia for nearly a decade.</p><p>He's one of three former CIA agents in congress. The others are all Democrats. Congresswoman Abigail Spanberger, Elissa Slotkin. There's also a former FBI agent in the House, Republican Brian Fitzpatrick.</p><p>Well, Lieutenant Colonel Alexander Vindman will reportedly remain on the National Security Council, even after providing testimony against President Trump.</p><p>Vindman's attorney says his client will stay on as a Ukraine expert until his detail ends in July of next year. That's really strange, isn't it?</p><p>Well, joining us now to tell us what he thinks of that and more, Tom Fitton, he's the President of Judicial Watch. And there are a lot of strange things for us discuss -- to discuss here tonight.</p><p>Tom, let's start out with Vindman. What is the deal? Robert O'Brien, the national security advisor, he is restructuring the National Security Council and its staff, why not just move him, his brother, whomever, out?</p><p>TOM FITTON, JUDICIAL WATCH PRESIDENT: I don't know. He shouldn't be there. If I were the president, I don't know how we can expect the president to have any trust in this person's work.</p><p>Obviously, given his personal dislike for the president and his policies. This is as man who substituted his views on what Ukraine should be doing for the views of the president of the United States.</p><p>To me, it should mean that he should be nowhere near any policy making body for the government. So, I guess the line is, he'll just move along when his detail is over. And I don't think they should wait for the detail to be over.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, it makes you wonder what kind of rational process there is available because here is -- as you say, I mean, the president clearly wouldn't trust who doesn't care for the president's policies on Ukraine.</p><p>Why put up with that? Why not just give him something else to do? He's after all a public servant, serving in uniform at least when he's testifying against the president. He might be better used in another post where he would be credible, perhaps, and have greater opportunity.</p><p>FITTON: You know, and this is another example of how the deep state is able to work its ways. You have all these detailee's going over to National Security Council.</p><p>Many of whom don't appreciate the president or support him. And similarly, you have detailee's going over and work with Congress to undermine the president of the United States.</p><p>You've got federal officials, federal employees working with the majority in congress. I bet you right now on this coup effort.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, that's an interesting point. And you know, maybe the president could maybe go over to the Pentagon and spend more time with -- rather than having to send people or drop over to the CIA, just kind of, you know, have coffee with them from time to time.</p><p>FITTON: Reform is needed, Lou. We've got to protect the republic from these administrative overlords.</p><p>DOBBS: It's stunning. And there he is, let's be clear, Vindman referred to the interagency. And my goodness, there was a reverence in the words on paper.</p><p>As he spoke them in his opening statement, I mean, he talks about the interagency as you would expect say he would refer to the commander-in- chief to the White House, to the Pentagon, to the command structure, no. He worships at the altar of the interagency. It is stunning stuff.</p><p>FITTON: Well, these are the -- this is the Praetorian Guard that the attorney general has warned us about. These are individuals in the administration or in any administration, who believe they know better than the elected president of the United States.</p><p>And this is the harm that's being done to our republic. You have individuals who disagree with the president of policy -- on policy who are being brought in to suggest that that disagreement means he needs to be removed from office.</p><p>And that is a fundamental threat to our constitutional republic. And just look, you know, this is the alleged whistleblower whose name we're not supposed to mention. You know, he was a CIA officer allegedly over in the White House. Now, we got the documents about who he was visiting with.</p><p>DOBBS: I've got to -- I've got do this because you mentioned the word, whistleblower. No, I'm kidding. I'm kidding.</p><p>FITTON: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: We've got a -- we've a got a hard commercial break in about seven seconds. If you would please stay with us to the commercial break and we'll take up whistleblower next. We'll be right back.</p><p>DOBBS: Breaking news tonight, Mick Mulvaney will have to file his own law suit tomorrow in order to ask a judge whether to decide -- to decide whether he should comply with a subpoena from the -- well, the Radical Dems in congress who are carrying out their farce of an inquiry.</p><p>A judge today, making the decision that he would not allow Mulvaney to join a lawsuit by John Bolton's Deputy Charles Kupperman and Bolton himself.</p><p>We're back with Tom Fitton, the president of Judicial Watch and I want to continue our discussion about Will Hurd and the whistleblower.</p><p>But, first, I want to -- I'll get your assessment of this breaking news now that Bolton and Kupperman will have their own separate lawsuit apart from Mulvaney.</p><p>FITTON: Well, in some ways it's not surprising, I haven't seen the judge's ruling. But I suspect that you have -- just different legal issues and the judge says you've got to pursue this lawsuit separately, Mr. Mulvaney.</p><p>But either way, you've now have three officials lawfully objecting to a subpoena by Congress. And what is the coup cabal saying in response to that?</p><p>You're objecting in federal court to our request following the rule of law as evidence of guilt. And it's a reason to remove the president. This is the Alice in Wonderland over carrying the constitution approach that the Pelosi-Schiff coup cabal is engaging in.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah. And in each instance, we're talking about absolute denial of due process.</p><p>FITTON: That's right.</p><p>DOBBS: We're talking about overriding executive privilege. And we're talking about a process that does not include the second party of this two- party system operating without precedent, without participation, without equity, and without any right to call their own witnesses or to cross- examine. It's ridiculous. It is -- and its worse, a dark farce.</p><p>FITTON: And the -- and the worst part of it as we talk about last night, Lou, is the protection of this alleged whistleblower. The idea that this person who is alleged to have improperly change -- exchange information with Mr. Schiff who lied about it.</p><p>Who may have been improperly talking about the presidential phone call which is classified at the time internally within the administration, that he wouldn't be questioned about what he knew and when and who he was talking to and what they were talking to -- they were talking about like Mr. Colonel Vindman.</p><p>It's an abomination of the law here. And I'll you, we're asking questions about what the -- now, there's a name out there associated with the whistleblower.</p><p>We've looked at the White House visitor logs under Barack Obama and saw that he had -- at least two meetings with related to the Ukraine issue specifically with the Soros groups tied in this effort by Ukrainians to target President Trump. So --</p><p>DOBBS: Which Soros' groups?</p><p>FITTON: This is the Ukrainian Soros group that leaked the black ledger, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: Right.</p><p>FITTON: Two meetings with this -- with this person. And I don't know if he's the whistleblower, but is it interesting the Obama White House is meeting with this person.</p><p>And is it interesting that no one wants to talk to the CIA official assigned to the both the Obama White House and the Trump White House to handle Ukraine. Why isn't he being questioned irrespective of whether he's a whistleblower.</p><p>DOBBS: All good points and Will Hurd insisting that the whistleblower, quote, unquote, and we use the expression whistleblower but he doesn't fit the classic definition of whistleblower, does he?</p><p>Because the actions that we're -- he's whistle blowing were outside the intelligence community, were they not?</p><p>FITTON: Look, he's not a whistleblower under the law. And the classic definition of the whistleblower is someone who sees something wrong and tells their superiors about it.</p><p>He went to congress initially, as I said improperly and maybe talked about classified information which would raise significant legal issues for him.</p><p>So you know, we've worked with whistleblowers here all the time at Judicial Watch. This is the -- this is the opposite whistle blowing. This is leaking. This is conspiracy. And Adam Schiff's involved in it and he's making decisions where the American people will know about his involvement. He's conflicted and should be kicked off the impeachment inquiry if it's to proceed sat all.</p><p>DOBBS: Tom Fitton, as always, great to have you with us. Thanks, Tom.</p><p>FITTON: You're welcome. A major court case will be heard tomorrow in Washington. The Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments tomorrow over President Trump's 2017 decision to abolish DACA.</p><p>Three separate nationwide injunctions have previously prohibited the Trump administration from ending the Obama-era program all together.

And on a programming note, the Republican National Committee's Ronna McDaniel and Director of Citizenship and Immigration Services Ken Cuccinelli among our guests here tomorrow evening. We hope you'll join us.</p><p>Well, up next, a secret Google project. Apparently has found a new invasive way to mine your personal data. We'll have that story and what's being done about it if anything, right after these messages. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: Google has reported to have begun gathering personal health data of millions of Americans, according to the Wall Street Journal.</p><p>Google started that project nightingale as it's called last year. They partnered with Ascension, which is the nation's second largest healthcare system.</p><p>The two have gathered healthcare information on people across 21 states. And they apparently have done so without notifying doctors or patients.</p><p>Google claims that project is completely in line with federal law. And if it is, in my humble opinion, federal law had better get changed and now.</p><p>Well, joining us, Kelly Sadler, former assistant -- special assistant to the president, she is now director of communications at America First Policies and America First Action, that action part. I really like it.</p><p>KELLY SADLER, FMR SPECIAL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT TRUMP: Yeah, action. We're going into action for the president.</p><p>DOBBS: Good to see you.</p><p>SADLER: Nice to see you, Lou.</p><p>DOBBS: And I have to say, if Google is doing this, the president talked about taking on big tech before anybody else.</p><p>SADLER: Yeah. Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: Is he going to take on big tech because this is really getting outrageous when they can do something like this with a healthcare group.</p><p>SADLER: Yeah -- no. It seems like this is a bipartisan issue on the hill too --</p><p>DOBBS: Absolutely.</p><p>SADLER: -- in terms of people looking into antitrust suits against Google, what they are doing with this information that they are accumulating.</p><p>We've already know that, you know, they had to pay out, you know, over 100 million dollars, I think $170 million because YouTube was illegally gathering information about children and consumers and then basing ads on that.</p><p>DOBBS: This is a big issue.</p><p>SADLER: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: Privacy and data being that is being exploited by big tech and others. It got to be dealt with --</p><p>SADLER: Yeah. And then -- and then them not notifying, you know, the consumers that they are gathering this information, there was a breach or and -- not wanting to release this like with Google+ because they don't want to get into any regulatory affairs in D.C.</p><p>DOBBS: Well, let's get into the nuts and bolts of campaigning 2020 and we're looking at polls on suburban women. It seems to be an issue for the president. How big an issue is it?</p><p>SADLER: Well, I don't think it's that big of an issue and let me tell you why.</p><p>DOBBS: Sure.</p><p>SADLER: The campaign just released some information about, you know, basically, they've had over 10,000 women suburban donors, big money donors that have contributed more than $8 million to the campaign. That puts the president number one in kind of this large group of women suburban donors among all of the campaigns including the Democratic races that are going on.</p><p>And we've been doing focus groups with suburban women across America and what we've found is that the hidden Trump vote is a real one that you have to kind of pullout from these women.</p><p>Like -- they don't like talking about politics, they don't like talking about the -- you know, this kind of -- they don't like getting into it, but once they do, they recognize that this president has provided them, you know, the lowest unemployment rate in 65 years.</p><p>The child tax care credit was doubled under his tax cut act. They recognize the good policies but then say, you know, but we never put a Trump bumper sticker on our car.</p><p>DOBBS: Because of the perceived suburban consensus.</p><p>SADLER: There was one woman who said I don't want my car to be knifed.</p><p>DOBBS: Yeah, well --</p><p>SADLER: And have that backlashed. And they don't want to get into these arguments.</p><p>DOBBS: Did your polling show anything like this during the 2016 campaign, an aversion to publicly supporting the president?</p><p>Well, we weren't around in 2016. We're coming for as to re-elect the package. But one of the things that my boss, Brian Walshaw (ph) says is that, this hidden vote is real.</p><p>And that the pundits and the political elites back in 2016 totally dismissed it, and the polls were wrong. And these are the people that are never put -- you know, put up in polls because they just don't respond to these questions. They don't want to respond.</p><p>DOBBS: And the president making it very clear, the president will make whatever adjustments required to fix those things, I have no doubt.</p><p>He's also trying to make the Republican Party understand not to be led into a fool's trap. That is too many Republican office holders have said the president's call with Zelensky was okay. But part of it was bad and but it was not impeachable.</p><p>SADLER: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: What -- just read the transcript. These lawmakers need to read the transcript. It's out there. There are three things that are not in the transcript.</p><p>No speak of the 2020 re-election. There is no quid pro quo and there's no withholding of aid. The only thing that we're seeing here is these lawmakers -- this hidden, you know, kangaroo court.</p><p>Basically where there's no due justice, no due process for the president. The lawmakers need to read the transcript and have the president's back here because he did nothing wrong and the call was perfectly fine and he's well within his presidential powers of foreign policy to have that call.</p><p>DOBBS: any one of those congressman or senators should have the intelligence and the understanding of law and public policy and politics to understand you support the president, you don't play at it. You support it.</p><p>SADLER: Yeah.</p><p>DOBBS: Particularly when the state of the future of the party is at stake. Kelly, great to have you with us.</p><p>SADLER: Thanks so much, Lou. I appreciate it.</p><p>DOBBS: Thanks so much. Up next. The commander-in-chief honors the service and sacrifice of our nation's veterans. We'll have his message right after this quick break. Stay with us.</p><p>DOBBS: President Trump today becoming the first commander-in-chief ever to attend the New York City Veterans Day parade. President Trump has a long history with the parade.</p><p>In 1995 organizers had received zero donations. Until then businessman Donald J. Trump stepped in and gave somewhere around $350,000 to the parade.</p><p>That unleashed a windfall of contributions to the parades organizers and saved the parade. During a speech today, President Trump hailed the legacy of America's Armed Forces and honored their many sacrifices.</p><p>That's it for us tonight. We thank you for being with us here tonight. Tomorrow night we will have Ronna McDaniel, the head of the RNC, and Ken Cuccinelli, the head of Citizenship and Immigration Services that's tomorrow.</p><p>We hope you'll be with us for that and much more. Thanks for being with us this evening. Good night from New York.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">LOUDOB-2019111101cb229</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">LOUDOB2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGM-G6N1-JB20-G45M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6583\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fox Business Network LLC All Rights Reserved </copyright><publicationName>Lou Dobbs Tonight</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 11, 2019 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"typeofdoc\"><classificationItem><className>Show</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0001X0M</classCode><className>INTEL CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>SIC4833 TELEVISION BROADCASTING STATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

Yet still we spend hours a day on the world's biggest social media platforms - but should we? This Herald series explains exactly what's at stake when you like your friend's Facebook post, Google symptoms when you're sick and share fake news. Damien Venuto and Chris Keall report</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She was six months' pregnant when the anti-abortion lobbying started coming in.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Auckland mum-to-be Natalia Lopez had grown used to the steady stream of cots, prams and baby onesies that mirrored her online searches.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The same could not, however, be said when she scrolled down her newsfeed to see a graphic anti-abortion video clip from Family First buried among posts from family and friends.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She'd never seen anything from the organisation before and it seemed strange to suddenly be receiving messages so pertinent to her situation.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The video was titled \"Before you defend abortion, be sure to understand what you're defending\" and featured a graphic animation of a foetus being ripped apart limb by limb during a second trimester abortion.  </p><p>\"What disturbs me most about it was that they didn't know what I was going through when I was targeted with these ads,\" Lopez told the Herald.  </p><p>\"I could have been in the middle of making one of the toughest decisions a woman can make and to have a lobby group pushing their view on to me just didn't seem right.\"  </p><p>Lopez was further annoyed because the information was skewed to favour the anti-abortion argument: \"It was all emotionally loaded. And the animation also depicted the foetus much larger and with more defined features than you would see during that stage of the pregnancy.\"  </p><p>Lopez tagged the video as misleading and hasn't seen anything from Family First since. (The Herald checked with national director Bob McCoskrie, who told us the video was targeted at anyone over 18 and that 142,000 people had watched it on Facebook.)  </p><p>This is simply the world we live in. Social media firms know when we're engaged, pregnant, on holiday, sick or worried about balding. Companies watch our movements online to ensure they can feed us the most relevant information - in the hope of securing that sale.  </p><p>Lopez could, of course, simply quit Facebook. But in 2020, that's not so easy. The likes of Facebook, the Facebook-owned Instagram and WhatsApp, and Twitter have become integral to how we keep up with family and friends. And for most of us, they're intertwined with our work lives, too.  </p><p>For most of us, checking our social feeds is the first thing we do when we wake, and the last thing we do before sleeping. And in between those social media bookends to our day, we spend a staggering six hours online each day on average. But how much do you really know about those social media platforms and what data they are collecting about you?  </p><p>Think about everything you've googled. Your secrets, your health concerns, your symptoms, your hopes, insecurities - everything punched into an algorithm and stored out of view until it later becomes relevant. How much is all this information worth? And how powerful is it?  </p><p>And did you know that your attention is being manipulated to keep you on these platforms so your attention can be sold to advertisers? You're not just getting a newsfeed from the friends and family you follow - an algorithm has tracked your interests and dishes up the posts that will keep you hooked. The company introduced the 'like' button on its posts so you keep going back for that dopamine hit.  </p><p>As Steve Andriole recently wrote for Forbes, \"Every time we blog, tweet, post, rideshare, order from Amazon, rent an Airbnb - or anything that leaves a digital trail - we feed into this surveillance capitalism\".  </p><p>You may have been broadly aware Facebook tailors your newsfeed to interests you've revealed while using it. But did you know Facebook tracks you even when you're not using it?  </p><p>We know this because in January Facebook launched its Activity Tracker feature that reveals many businesses share your real-world activity with the social media giant.  </p><p>Facebook is to be commended for finally making this information transparent - albeit with some nudging from regulators and politicians - but the scope of its information-harvesting is still staggering.  </p><p>For example, even if you love Domino's but have never mentioned it on Facebook - or even pizza - the social network might still throw up ads for a discount off your next Simply Cheese.  </p><p>That's because Domino's is one of thousands of companies that have a business relationship with Facebook that sees them share your so-called \"off-Facebook\" activity - which might be a visit to a website, a search, or a purchase from one of its stores.  </p><p>Facebook says sensitive data, such as health and financial information, are not included in the information trading. But the Wall Street Journal and others have noted health and fitness, weight-loss, heart-rate and maternity wear and even ovulation apps have shared information with the social network.  </p><p>A Wall Street Journal reporter complained about targeted apps related to her recent download of the What to Expect pregnancy app. Privacy International, a British-based charity, reported in September that several menstruation cycle-tracking apps have been sharing their users' intimate details with the social network - including the last time a user had unprotected intercourse. These apps included Maya (more than five million downloads) and Period Tracker MIA Fem: Ovulation Calculator (over two million users).  </p><p>Better news: Facebook now lets you see most of the businesses that have shared information about you, and a broad outline of the activity they've recorded (it says for \"technical reasons\" not everything is revealed to you. And that includes, for example, items you put in an online shopping cart).  </p><p>While logged in to Facebook, navigate to \"Office Facebook Activity\" through settings or visit it directly here. From that screen, you can also turn off tracking, company by company, if you don't like personalised ads. But pack a lunch. This reporter had 595 apps and websites sharing off-Facebook activity (including the Herald, among other local and international publishers).  </p><p>Turning each one off takes time.  </p><p>Facebook does offer an option to zap all sharing at once. Go to facebook.com/off - facebook - activity/activity - list then click Manage Future Activity. But there is a catch - you'll be logged out of sites and services where you've chosen to log on using your Facebook details - a handy time saver. For those sites - if you want to turn them off - you'll have to change your account details so you log on with your email address and a password. (Facebook is banking on you finding this too inconvenient, and throwing in the towel).  </p><p>98 pieces of information  </p><p>The Washington Post recently revealed that Facebook actively tries - through monitoring your on and off-Facebook activity - to discover 98 separate pieces of information about you to help it make the billions of dollars it does every year through targeted ads.  </p><p>According to a Washington Post story which revealed how the social network targets advertisers, the 98 points include perhaps unsurprising things such as your gender and age, but also whether your politics are conservative or liberal, whether you're a heavy buyer of alcohol, the groceries you buy and types of holidays you enjoy.  </p><p>If you think that sounds Big Brother, take a smidgen of comfort from the fact Facebook is less intrusive than it used to be. The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 revealed that people who took a personality test on Facebook in 2016 (including 63,714 Kiwis) not only shared their personal data with Donald Trump's presidential campaign (via fine print most had not read) but inadvertently volunteered their Facebook friends' data to be shared, without their knowledge, as well.  </p><p>That loophole is now closed, but there's still plenty of snooping going on, even if these days it's confined to your own account.  </p><p>To retake control, visit Facebook.com/settings. Then click on the Ads tab, then your interests. From there, you can delete various \"interests\" that Facebook has assigned to you.

Google is defending the action and since the period of alleged offending has added its incognito mode, mentioned above).  </p><p>The Harmful Digital Communications Act (2015) has given Kiwis a useful tool when they think they are being cyberbullied. The law came with an \"approved agency\" to enforce it: NetSafe, which can advocate on your behalf if you have an issue with the likes of Facebook, Twitter or Google.  </p><p>In terms of concerns about the social media platforms invading your privacy, the Privacy Act (1993) has not been a hugely effective tool - unsurprisingly, given it was authored before the internet went mainstream.  </p><p>An update to the Act is still going through Parliament (it passed its second reading late last year) but is expected to go into force this year.  </p><p>Privacy Commissioner John Edwards did not get several items on his wishlist, including the ability to levy fines of up to $1m on misbehaving companies, or a provision for \"data portability\" - meaning you own information collected about you, rather than the company which harvested it, and you can take it with you after you close an account.  </p><p>But he did get others included, such as mandatory data breach disclosure - so soon, any organisation will have to tell you if it loses your data to hackers.  </p><p>And, in terms of social media privacy for everyday users, Edwards points to two new powers his office will enjoy under the new law. First, \"It clarifies the law so there is no room for ambiguity about overseas companies and whether they come under the jurisdiction of our privacy law,\" he says.  </p><p>In a 2018 stoush with the Privacy Commissioner's office, Facebook said it need not comply with the NZ Privacy Act because it had no office here.  </p><p>\"When the Privacy Bill comes into force, I'll have the ability to issue compliance notices to business to improve the digital environment for consumers, whether you are based here, or just doing business here,\" Edwards said.  </p><p>The Privacy Commissioner said he would take aim at \"click-to-consent\", or one-click acceptance of terms and conditions that can run to thousands of words of legalese. His message to Big Tech: Attempts to bury privacy-invasion provisions deep in the fine print must stop. While he is optimistic, it could be that test cases are required, given Facebook's moving-feast terms and conditions have variously had its NZ membership under Irish and now US privacy law - at least in its view.  </p><p>He would prefer the Big Tech companies take what he calls a \"privacy by design\" approach, with elements such as location tracking and face-recognition turned off by default, and only enabled with informed user consent. As things stand, we're some distance from his ideal.      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NZHRLD-NZHdigitalstrapp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NZHRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBH-SWP1-F12B-J0B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">257912</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2024\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The New Zealand Herald All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The New Zealand Herald</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 4, 2020</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Bernie Sanders assailed the power of Wall Street and the pharmaceutical industry. Cory Booker vowed to appoint more judges and antitrust enforcers and even Joe Biden is preparing a trust-busting plan. Democratic presidential hopefuls are coming out in force against the rapid pace of corporate consolidation, a message to 2020 voters that gained volume during their first debates in Miami last week. </p><p>They're expanding their pledges to take on big tech, including Facebook and Alphabet, to other industries. Attacking big corporations is both a political message and a policy prescription. It's one way Democrats think they can address the concerns of voters who have fallen behind, even as the U.S. economy continues to expand. As Democrats gear up to try to take back the White House in 2020, they hope the anti-corporate tone taps into the populist passion that propelled Donald Trump in 2016. \"Whoever is elected on the Democratic side would be more aggressive on antitrust than we have seen in decades,\" said Jason Furman, a former chairman of President Barack Obama's Council of Economic Advisers who chairs a U.K. initiative on digital competition. So far, voters views are mixed, but it's a message that could take hold as frustration grows with large companies and concerns, including how personal data are being used. Some of the party's top candidates are warning of a new robber-baron era, recalling the powerful oil and steel behemoths of the late 19th and early 20th centuries that the first American antitrust laws were designed to tame. Their campaigns often cite studies showing that consolidation may be responsible for higher wealth inequality, slower productivity growth, fewer startups and stagnant wages. The candidates are putting together plans to target a wide range of industries including agribusiness, telecom and health care. Booker, for example, has offered legislation that places an indefinite moratorium on acquisitions in the food and agriculture sector and Amy Klobuchar sponsored an antitrust overhaul that would require merging companies to prove their consolidation wouldn't harm competition. The proposals mark a shift from previous administrations that had a lighter regulatory touch, allowing consolidation in almost every sector of the economy. More than three-quarters of U.S. industries over the last two decades have seen an increase in concentration, studies show. Markups - how much a company charges for a product above its own costs - have soared, another sign of rising market power. These findings are consistent with research showing a smaller number of firms across the U.S. economy capturing a greater share of sales, giving rise to so-called superstar companies. Democrats already started questioning this trend after winning the House majority last year. Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the antitrust subcommittee chairman, is investigating concentration in the tech industry. The U.S., he has said, is in the midst of a \"monopoly moment\" that stifles competition. One of Cicilline's questions is why there hasn't been a \"serious antitrust investigation\" in 20 years. At the same time, the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission have carved up oversight of four tech giants, with the Justice Department taking responsibility for Alphabet's Google and Apple, while the FTC is investigating Facebook and Amazon.com. These inquiries could gather steam under a Democratic president, who sets the tone for antitrust enforcement through appointees to the Justice Department and the FTC. A Democratic White House would also likely deploy broader agency regulatory authority to check the power of companies in many industries. That includes the Transportation Department on airlines, the Department of Health and Human Services on insurance and pharmaceutical companies, the Federal Communications Commission on telecom providers, and the Agriculture Department on agribusiness giants.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HCHRN-MERLIN68631060</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HCHRN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WH3-8121-JC8S-D2R4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8380</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"671\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Hearst Newspapers, a division of Hearst Communications, Inc.

There's Big Pharma. There's Big Tech and Big Coal and Big Banks and Big Oil. Now comes the latest major lobbying organization to throw its weight around and demonstrate the astounding hold that corporate conservatives have on all three branches of the U.S. government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Say hello to Big Baby.</p><p>The New York Times reported last week that during this year's World Health Assembly in May, the U.S. delegation tried to undermine a resolution encouraging women around the world to breastfeed their babies. The assembly is the annual meeting of delegates from 194 nations to the United Nations-affiliated World Health Organization.</p><p>For decades, health experts have agreed that mother's milk is better for infants than commercial baby formulas. The resolution urged member countries to regulate the misleading marketing claims of formula manufacturers. The resolution was in no way controversial until the U.S. delegation, representing the interests of Big Baby, started stirring up trouble.</p><p>Ecuador, which was scheduled to introduce the resolution, was threatened with trade retaliation and the possible withdrawal of U.S. military aid. Other nations, fearing similar threats, backed down. Eventually the Russians, of all people, agreed to introduce the resolution, and it passed mostly unchanged.</p><p>If there's any nation the Trump administration won't mess with, it's Russia.</p><p>\"We're not trying to be a hero here,\" a Russian delegate told the Times, \"but we feel that it is wrong when a big country tries to push around some very small countries, especially on an issue that is really important for the rest of the world.\"</p><p>This is the sort of thing that U.S. officials used to be able to say. Today they do the bidding of corporate interests. More than three-fourths of the U.S. baby food market is controlled by just three companies: Nestl\u00e9 USA (Gerber), Abbott Inc. of suburban Chicago (Similac) and Mead Johnson of Chicago (Enfamil). All three are part of Big Baby's $47 billion-a-year global market, which is expected to grow by 50 percent in the next three years no matter what the World Health Assembly says.</p><p>With Donald Trump in the White House, Republicans in control of Congress and a corporate majority on the Supreme Court, business has done spectacularly. But trying to convince mothers in the Third World to mix up baby formula - despite having no reliable supply of clean water to mix it with - is truly perverse.</p><p>It's the apotheosis for a movement that lay dormant during the years of the New Deal and the Great Society but began to emerge in the 1970s. Movement conservatives appropriated the word \"freedom\" as a substitute for untrammeled greed. It was truly brilliant how they did it.</p><p>They decided that the Gilded Age had it right, and that a nation's greatness should not be measured, as Gandhi said, by how it treats its weakest members, but by how much wealth its strongest members could amass. In support of this, they interpreted the Constitution's insistence on the primacy of property rights as fixed and unchanging.</p><p>The key moment came in 1976 when the Supreme Court decided that money, a measure of property, was a protected form of free speech when spent on political contributions. The loudest voices in the public square now belong to those with the most money.</p><p>Ronald Reagan became the movement's charismatic figurehead. Social issues like guns, gays and abortion (secondary concerns to most corporate conservatives) were used to divide the old Roosevelt coalition. Dog-whistle racist appeals fomented a backlash to the civil rights movement. Conservative intellectuals - to the extent that sophistic arguments on behalf of the privileged constitutes intellectualism - were planted in universities and courtrooms. Unions, with a big assist from certain corrupt union leaders, became a bad thing - even though collective wealth is the only counterbalance to individual wealth.</p><p>The stock market boomed. Executives compensation exploded. Blue-collar wages flatlined. A man named Leonard Leo built an obscure organization of conservative lawyers called the Federalist Society into a powerful force for the protection of corporate interests and wedge social issues. He is chiefly responsible for picking the conservative majority on the Supreme Court - including Brett Kavanaugh, the man Trump nominated last week as Justice Anthony Kennedy's replacement.</p><p>\"Leonard Leo was a visionary,\" Tom Carter, who worked as a public relations man for Leo, told The Daily Beast. \"He figured out 20 years ago that conservatives had lost the culture war. Abortion, gay rights, contraception - conservatives didn't have a chance if public opinion prevailed. So they needed to stack the courts.\"</p><p>Yes! Public opinion be damned. Just load up the courts with Federalist Society members and wait for the fun to begin. Steal a Supreme Court nomination. Ignore Trump's abuses as long as he supports the plutocratic agenda.</p><p>It's like taking candy from a baby. Or worse, mother's milk.</p><p>&gt; Kevin Horrigan, a retired member of the Post-Dispatch editorial board, is a St. Louis freelance writer.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p> 5/3/2000  ST.

But after recent pressure from shareholders, they may now think twice.</p><p>Facebook on Friday agreed it would not go through with a share reclassification that would have allowed the founder and controlling shareholder Mark Zuckerberg to sell off stock to fund his philanthropy, while still holding the same voting power. The decision came just days before Mr Zuckerberg was due to testify in a shareholder lawsuit challenging the arrangement.</p><p>Facebook's is the latest fight over multiple-class share structures at the biggest US tech companies, which have sparked Wall Street consternation over the protection of shareholder rights. Whereas at most companies one share equals one vote, some of the largest tech groups have created dual share classes to allow their founders to retain a greater percentage of voting rights.</p><p>Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at NYU Stern School of Business and the author of The Four: How Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google Divided and Conquered the World, said the Facebook court case showed it was getting harder for big technology companies to adopt share structures that favoured founders.</p><p>\"This goes against the general notion that influence should be somewhat correlated to ownership,\" he said. \"But I think the bigger story is the undercurrent has turned against big tech. Lawyers, regulators, politicians and judges are a bit fed up with the prom king who everyone finds charming.\"</p><p>Facebook had followed Alphabet, the parent company of Google that also changed its share structure to ensure its founders retained control.</p><p>This had three share classes: one for regular investors with voting power, another for founders with greater voting rights and a third with no vote.</p><p>Shareholders sued in that case as well, but settled on the eve of the trial. Alphabet's plan to issue shares with no voting rights went ahead, but the company agreed to compensate investors.</p><p>Snap, the owner of Snapchat, went public earlier this year offering shares that gave the most voting power to the two co-founders, prompting S&amp;PDow Jones Indices and FTSE Russell to announce over the northern summer that companies with multiple share classes would not be able to join their indices.</p><p>Facebook had sought to reclassify its shares in a similar way to Alphabet by creating a third, non-voting class that it would pay out as a dividend of two for every voting share.</p><p>Shareholders had argued it would dilute the value of their shares, and served only to benefit Mr Zuckerberg, who announced in late 2015 he planned to give away 99 per cent of his Facebook stock during his lifetime.</p><p>Erik Gordon, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said the case would influence other leaders looking to adopt similar structures. As large private tech companies such as Uber and Airbnb head to the public markets in the next couple of years, they may reconsider issuing shares with no, or negligible, votes.</p><p>Despite the furore surrounding dual or multiple-class companies, they are still a minority among the tech industry's largest groups, amounting to 13 companies out of 128, a study by the law firm Orrick found.</p><p>At Snap, prospective investors were told before the company went public that their shares would have no voting power, while co-founders Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy would retain shares of the company even if they were no longer executives at the group. Mr Spiegel's voting power would only be lessened if he sold off enough of his stake or died.</p><p>Ken Bertsch, executive director of the Council of Institutional Investors, was disappointed the issue would not now be tested in court. A ruling against the Facebook plan could have prevented other companies who might be considering Alphabet's lead in issuing non-voting shares, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc6wu69zjrt931eqp3ekxk</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PJR-K7W1-F0J6-J23M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Ed Case (D-Hawaii) on Friday, would make internet platforms liable when they host advertising for short-term rentals that violate state and city laws.</p><p>The measure is a top priority for the AHLA, which has spent more than $1.6 million on lobbying this year and has four firms on retainer, including Fierce Government Relations and Peck Madigan Jones.</p><p>Association members also pressed lawmakers to back the legislation during the group's annual fly-in on Wednesday.</p><p>\"For far too long, these Big Tech short-term rental platforms have been hiding behind this antiquated law in order to bully and threaten legal action against local elected officials who are simply trying to protect their residents from illegal rentals that are destroying neighborhoods and access to affordable housing,\" AHLA President and CEO Chip Rogers said in a statement.</p><p>The group has a strong ally in Case, who was senior vice president and chief legal officer at Outrigger Hotels Hawaii from 2013 to 2018 and previously served on the AHLA's board.</p><p>In a statement, Case criticized the short-term rental industry, saying it is responsible for \"the loss of affordable housing as residential units are converted to transient accommodations for tourists.\"</p><p>\"Many of the owners and operators of these units are failing to comply with basic consumer safety, public accommodations and tax requirements that the legal lodging industry has had to follow in order to conduct its business,\" he added.</p><p>Case said that he resigned from the AHLA board in 2017 and has had \"no further personal or professional engagements with the visitor industry (other than for representing a district where tourism is the top economic generator and private employer).\"</p><p>His bill already has bipartisan support. Republican Reps. Pete King (N.Y.) and Ralph Norman (S.C.) are co-sponsors, as is Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (Ill.).</p><p>The measure now awaits action from the House Energy and Commerce Committee, where Chairman Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.) and ranking member Greg Walden (R-Ore.) sent a joint letter last month to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer urging him to avoid including language in trade agreements that's similar to the federal third-party protections for internet platforms known as Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act (CDA).</p><p>\"Sec 230 is meant to enable platforms to take down harmful content. It should not be a shield for inaction,\" Pallone tweeted in May in response to news of Facebook addressing political disinformation.</p><p>The hotel-rental fight over Section 230 comes as the tech industry is facing increased scrutiny in Washington on a number of fronts; lawmakers in both parties have called for revisiting web companies' internet protections.</p><p>President Trump signed a bill last year that limits the immunity of Section 230 on platforms that knowingly host content that promotes or assists human trafficking and prostitution. The White House is also reportedly working on an executive order to address anti-conservative bias on the internet that could affect Section 230.</p><p>The short-term rental lobby is gearing up for a fight against the bill, pushing back on multiple aspects of its provisions. One of their arguments is that the battle should be at the local level.</p><p>The Travel Technology Association, the trade group that represents Expedia, Airbnb, VRBO, Booking.com, Priceline and Trip Advisor, argues that Section 230 is the wrong way to address the issue.</p><p>\"Amending the CDA for every special interest, such as the hotel lobby, is a flawed approach,\" Steve Shur, president of the association, told The Hill. \"In the context of the broader conversation around Section 230 and legitimate societal challenges, to associate vacation rentals in the same conversation with extremism, illegal gun sales and the opioid crisis is outrageous in its assertion and downright ludicrous to even suggest.\"</p><p>The group said its first step is to educate lawmakers about the legislation.</p><p>\"The motivations behind this bill are clear \u00af to serve the special interests of the hotel lobby \u00af and Congress shouldn't take the bait,\" Shur said.</p><p>The bill is the latest battle in a long-running fight between the hotel industry and the short-term rental platforms, with hoteliers lobbying for tougher restrictions on businesses like Airbnb in cities and states across the country.</p><p>In Washington, the D.C. Council gave preliminary approval to a bill in October that would regulate Airbnb and other short-term rental companies but delayed passage because the measure, introduced by Democratic Councilman Kenyan McDuffie, was predicted to cost the city $104 million over four years. It would impose strict limits on property owners from short-term rentals on second homes, spare bedrooms or basements.</p><p>Companies that deal in short-term rentals argue they are working with local governments to address concerns.</p><p>\"Expedia Group believes in sensible regulation for all segments of the travel ecosystem\u00afincluding short-term rentals. We are working closely with cities and states on fair and effective policies that address community concerns, encourage compliance, and support local vacation rental homeowners and managers,\" Philip Minardi, Expedia Group's director of policy communications, said in a statement.</p><p>Expedia owns Hotels.com, Hotwire, Trivago, Orbitz and Travelocity, among other brands, and has spent $560,000 this year on lobbying.</p><p>Minardi noted that cities like Seattle and Louisville are implementing policies that work well for both short-term rental companies and the hotel industry.</p><p>\"Unfortunately, the policy introduced today would jeopardize the important collaboration that's taking place at the state and local level,\" he said of the Case bill.</p><p>In the weeks ahead, Minardi said, Expedia will reach out to policymakers so they \"understand the proactive work that is being done to craft fair and effective policies across the nation and the impact that this proposal would have on those efforts.\"</p><p>Shur, of the Travel Technology Association, called the Case bill a \"hotel-backed proposal by a former hotel lobbyist turned member of Congress\" and a \"blatant attempt to do the hotel industry's bidding ... with the hopes of stifling competition from the innovative companies that have helped make short-term rentals and home-sharing popular.\"</p><p>He added that the CDA \"maintains a reasonable standard for e-commerce.\"</p><p>Tech companies have long praised Section 230 protections as clearing the way for the growth of the internet.</p><p>Steve DelBianco, president of e-commerce trade group NetChoice, which promotes free speech on the internet, called Section 230 \"the greatest internet law that no one's ever heard of.\"</p><p>He said issues with short-term rentals should be addressed at the local level.</p><p>\"Congress should not get involved with how the city of Austin, Texas, enforces its lodging and local zoning laws against property owners,\" DelBianco said. \"But Congress is being pulled into this competitive conflict because Section 230 is a federal law and bars local governments from imposing liability on a platform for commerce and communication that came from users.\"</p><p>Carl Szabo, NetChoice's general counsel, argued that Case's bill would encourage platforms to be less responsive to take down content of bad actors, which is a component of Section 230 and could lead to platforms not doing any moderation at all, similar to how 8chan operates.</p><p>\"This bill would create disincentives for short term rental platforms to engage in active, aggressive, monitoring of homeowners,\" he said.</p><p>Like others in the short-term rental lobby, DelBianco said NetChoice plans to educate lawmakers \"on the general hazards of punching holes in Section 230.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HILLNW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HILLNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X64-7J61-DYTB-V01F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">153182</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1438\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2019 Capitol Hill Publishing Corp.

In part, this was due to a lack of staff. For much of the last year, the FTC had only two sitting commissioners. Mainly, however, it was due to ideology.Two of the most influential recent commissioners-- Maureen Ohlhausen and Josh Wright-- were strong proponents of libertarian competition philosophy, with its strong pro-monopoly bent. Further, even many recent Democratic appointments tended to take ahighly permissiveapproach to economic power.But a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on February 14 provided strong signals that the FTC may soon be back in the business of promoting competition in the United States. All five FTC commissioners are being replaced more or less at the same time, which means the character of the agency has the potential to change dramatically. And among both senators and nominees, the libertarian thinking that has long held sway in the Commission appeared to be decidedly out of fashion. \u2022 Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), a former director of policy planning at the FTC, has in the past largely opposed government regulations, including net neutrality.But at the hearing last week, Sen. Cruz expressed deep concern about the immense power wielded byGoogle and Facebook, citing acover story[1] inEsquirethat calls for the break-up of big tech. Sen. Cruz appeared especially concerned about the anti-competitiveimplicationsof Facebook and Google's dominance, saying that their \"market power, size, and control of public discourse is unprecedented.\"\u2022 Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) urged the nominees to use the \"new populismsweeping the country\" as a mandate to invigorate enforcement and advocacy. \"Going beyond the FTC being a resource, I'd also like you to be a champion,\" he said. \"You have the bully pulpit. You can bring zeal and passion to consumer issues that no one else will do at the federal level.\" Sen. Blumenthal also submitteda statement from the Congressional Antitrust Committee into the hearing record.\u2022 Joe Simons, nominated by President Trump to chair the agency, said he wants to scrutinize dominant firms that wield market power and review the Commission's enforcement record. 'At a high level, I don't believe that big is necessarily bad,' he said. But he added,'Companies that are already big and influential can sometimes use inappropriate means, anti-competitive means, to get big or to stay big.'In particular, Simons said he was \"very concerned\"aboutdrug pricing and would explore convening a drug pricing monitoring task force to track anti-competitive price spikes and enable prompt investigations and enforcement actions.\u2022 In discussing extreme consolidation in agriculture with Sen. John Tester (D-MT), Simons further explained that even when bad mergers cannot be easily unscrambled, the agency can investigate dominant industry players for anti-competitive conduct and target their power through injunctions. Coupled with hiswritten comments, Simons' remarks suggestheintends to target abusive actions by dominant companies.\u2022 The only Democratic nominee at the hearing, Rohit Chopra, expressedinterest in reviewing barriers to entry in monopolized markets. In particular, he noted that consolidated control over data creates hazards bothfor consumers and independent businesses. He said,\"Data breaches impose great deals of costs on small enterprises. The Equifax data breach led to significant losses for community banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions.\"\u2022 A fifth slot on the Commission, reserved for a Democrat, still lacks an official nominee.Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) has recommended to the White House that it nominatehis chief counsel, Rebecca Slaughter, for the position.The founding members of the House AntiTrust Caucus are some of the House's most progressive members: Ro Khanna (CA), Mark Pocan (WI), Rick Nolan (MN), David Cicciline (RI), Keith Ellison (MN) and Pramila Jayapal (WA).Austin Frerick has made fighting monopolies a key part of his platform, so it was no surprise when he told us that the Antitrust Caucus will be the \"first caucus I will join. Also as an Iowa congressman, I plan to make antitrust a central requirement for my endorsement in the 2020 caucuses.\"<url normalizedValue=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TWXEVAW4Cj8/Wo8kJveKoTI/AAAAAAABWuE/4BnozyrUBuYIwZbvWidqwmUl3844oGMKgCLcBGAs/s1600/DWT%2B3%2B-%2BUntitled%2BPage.jpegDerrick\">https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TWXEVAW4Cj8/Wo8kJveKoTI/AAAAAAABWuE/4BnozyrUBuYIwZbvWidqwmUl3844oGMKgCLcBGAs/s1600/DWT%2B3%2B-%2BUntitled%2BPage.jpegDerrick</url> Crowe, the progressive running for the open seat in the Austin/San Antonio corridor told us he \"would absolutely join the Congressional Anti-Trust Caucus. The rise of monopoly power threatens our bank accounts, worsens inequality, and undermines our political liberties. Busting trusts is defending democracy.\"      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/blueamerica18?refcode=thermometerLisa\">https://secure.actblue.com/contribute/page/blueamerica18?refcode=thermometerLisa</url> Brown, the economist who served as Chancellor of Washington State University, Spokane and is currently busy campaigning to replace Paul Ryan lieutenant Cathy McMorris Rodgers that us \"it's a basic tenet of Econ-101 that concentrated economic power in a market, in which only a few producers dominate, has adverse outcomes for consumers. Higher prices and less consumer satisfaction generally result from oligopoly and monopoly power. Effective federal regulation can counter these results. It's encouraging that some members of Congress are getting more active in this arena and I would welcome the opportunity to join them.\"And we'll leave the last word for Lillian Salerno, former Obama deputy secretary of Agriculture, who is running a vigorous campaign in north Dallas that takes on monopolization head on: \"Concentrated corporate power is out of control,\" she often says, \"and it's time for Congress to step up with a renewed focus on anti-monopoly rules and investigations.

The ground has shifted from the larger deals seen in 2015 and 2016 to a focus on middle market transactions or deals under $5 billion, said David Gibbons, Hogan Lovells Global Corporate Practice Group Leader.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Partners at the roundtable went on to discuss the following areas that are top of the agenda in deal making:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">1. Concerns over CFIUS and Inbound and Outbound Chinese Investment</p><p>We are facing a pretty challenging environment for Chinese investment, as CFIUS continues to scrutinize heavily the national security implications of a wide range of Chinese acquisitions. CFIUS also has a huge case load that has continued to increase over the past few years. The investments from China continue to come in, but a number of these transactions, stretching across various industries, are running into difficulties,\" said Hogan Lovells partner Brian Curran.</p><p>The number of industries in which CFIUS sees significant national security vulnerabilities appears to be expanding. Transactions involving large data sets, particularly protected health or personal information, are receiving increased scrutiny, even in sectors that historically weren't considered sensitive from a national security perspective. Some members of Congress, including Senator Chuck Schumer, have called for expanding CFIUS's mandate further to consider economic factors. In response to perceived Chinese government efforts to curb foreign investment in China, Members of Congress also have argued for changes to the CFIUS statute to allow the Committee to consider Chinese treatment of U.S. investments abroad, as a means of leveling the playing field.</p><p>Andrew McGinty spoke about China's new guidelines for outbound direct investments by Chinese companies which broke these down into three categories: encouraged, restricted and prohibited. Sectors like investments in infrastructure linked with the Belt and Road Initiative are at the top of the list in the encouraged category, while investments in real estate, hotels, entertainment and sports clubs are now in the restricted category.</p><p>\"We have largely gone to record filings across the board except in cases involving ODI in sensitive jurisdictions and sectors, but we have seen more recent caution in the market due to reported attempts by the Chinese government to rein in the activities of some of the most active Chinese ODI investors; China is worried about a drop off in foreign direct investment going the other way, so is trying to loosen up restrictions there too, with a recent move to record filing from the historical government approval requirement except in certain restricted sectors\" McGinty said. \"Belt and Road is driving M&amp;A initiatives right now, but the million dollar question is to what extent these huge infrastructure projects are going to opened up to involvement from Western countries.\"</p><p>2. Anxiety over Antitrust</p><p>There is a level of uncertainty in the M&amp;A market right now because there are still vacant positions at the DOJ and other regulatory agencies, and many are questioning where the administration will prioritize going forward, explained Hogan Lovells Antitrust partner Logan Breed. Breed broke down areas where he believes we could see enforcement decisions by this administration that differ from the prior administration. Those areas include:</p><p>Vertical transactions or deals where the merging companies involved don't have significant head to head competition because they are different levels of the supply chain;</p><p>Transactions that involve claims of significant merger-specific efficiencies;</p><p>And deals where potential competition is a meaningful issue.</p><p>\"The agencies will be less likely to challenge mergers in which the primary antitrust problem is potential competition in the future, and on the other hand they also may be more likely to accept merging parties' claims about the competitive significance of emerging and potential competitors,\" said Breed. \"In the past the government has been very skeptical of companies' claims of significant cost savings to consumers, but we may see more willingness by the DOJ and FTC to give more weight to such claims in the new administration.\"</p><p>3. 3. Tepid Technology M&amp;A</p><p>The overall dollar value of the technology M&amp;A deals announced thus far in 2017 is down; the full year total is not expected to reach the dollar totals seen in 2015 and 2016, which were both watershed years. In particular, there have been very few tech deals valued at over $5 billion so far this year.</p><p>The major technology companies hold large cash balances offshore, and some observers have suggested that the proposed Trump repatriation tax holiday could ignite the tech M&amp;A market. But not everyone shares that sentiment. \"There seems to be a perception that big tech acquirers are eagerly awaiting Trump's repatriation tax holiday, and that this measure is bound to trigger a surge of tech M&amp;A deal activity,\" said Hogan Lovells M&amp;A partner Rick Climan. \"But I don't think that's necessarily going to be the case. Remember what happened the last time we had a repatriation tax holiday, back in 2004. A large chunk of the repatriated cash was essentially used to fund share repurchases and dividends. That holiday was seen by many observers as a policy failure.\"</p><p>Don't look to PE buyers to fill the void by doing mega \"take private\" deals involving U.S. tech companies, said Climan. \"PE-backed 'take private' buyouts valued at more than $10 billion will continue to be rare in the U.S.,\" he said, pointing out that PE firms will continue to find it difficult in the current market to amass sufficient equity capital and to do deals with sufficient levels of leverage to fund massive individual \"take private\" buyouts. \"Much of the financial sponsor activity in the tech sector will be confined to the middle market,\" he said. He also pointed out that, except in situations where PE funds are able to do acquisitions through their existing portfolio companies, it may be difficult for PE funds to outbid strategic buyers in competitive sale processes, simply because strategic buyers are better able to generate cost and revenue synergies in the acquisitions they do.</p><p>One trend that may fuel future tech M&amp;A activity, Climan observed, is the continued expansion of the universe of potential buyers interested in acquiring tech companies. \"Traditional old economy companies, including those in the automotive and retail sectors, are recognizing that their future growth may depend on making significant acquisitions in the technology sector,\" he noted.</p><p>4. 4. Brexit's Impact on M&amp;A</p><p>In the past year the UK has been through a pretty turbulent period generally, with the Brexit vote and an unexpected general election. Companies have been taking stock and trying to figure out what might happen. That said, however, with the depreciation of the sterling, the UK is still an attractive market for investment and the deal market seems to be returning back to normal.</p><p>\"Clients say that now the decision to exit has been implemented by the trigger of Article 50, they believe that the UK is in a period of relative stability subject to how negotiations proceed,\" said Hogan Lovells partner Ben Higson. \"That is manifesting in businesses either divesting or acquiring to stabilize themselves, or creating joint ventures to strengthen their foothold in the market.\"</p><p>5. 5. The Surge in European M&amp;A</p><p>With so much uncertainty in other markets, the European market has been the most attractive area for investment and this can be witnessed in the enormous amount of M&amp;A activity throughout Continental Europe.</p><p>\"M&amp;A has been on the rise, and in fact, in Germany the amount of inbound deals have doubled, said Hogan Lovells partner Christoph Louven. \"There has been a wave of investments from both the US and China. Given that companies have a lot of cash on the balance sheet, there is also increased interest in outbound M&amp;A.\"</p><p>Contact: Adam Leviton, public relations manager (transactions), +44 20 7296 5299</p><p>Copyright Targeted News Services</p><p>MSTRUCK-6018751 MSTRUCK</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TNS-PR6018751</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TARGET2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PMW-24D1-JC11-1531-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">299219</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1404\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM  EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Targeted News Service LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Targeted News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>October 2, 2017 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp; Press Releases</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0005CZ7</classCode><className>HOGAN LOVELLS US LLP</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000749</classCode><className>FOREIGN INVESTMENT</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00090NP</classCode><className>MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000951</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL TRADE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001996</classCode><className>NATIONAL SECURITY</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000108</classCode><className>APPROVALS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001455</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000A2W7</classCode><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST00096KM</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE INVESTING</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE0009UR2</classCode><className>CHARLES SCHUMER</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC302</classCode><className>CHINA</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className><classCode/><className/></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>","Citation":""

Last quarter, wealth startups raised $1.2 billion in venture funding, up from $450 million during the first quarter, according to CB Insights data.Rebecca Ungarino asked VCs and other big investors to nominate early-stage startups in the wealth management ecosystem that they see as up-and-comers.

They argued that new form of direct listings would allow companies to circumvent shareholder protections built into the IPO process and thus put investors at risk.Yoonji Han talked with securities experts who laid out the critics concerns about 'untraceable' shares and fuzzy liability.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., who chairs the House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Antitrust, Commercial and Administrative Law, called for the FTC to look into a range of bold enforcement tactics against the company, citing what he believes to be a pattern of abusive privacy practices and anticompetitive behavior at the company. He urged the agency to explore the possibility of \"removing members of the company's board, or even top executives, along with other changes to the company's business model to address dysfunction at the top.\"</p><p>The agency, he says, is facing a credibility crisis and has not taken up a major monopoly case since it investigated Microsoft Corp. in the 1990s.</p><p>\"How the commission chooses to respond to Facebook's repeated abuses will determine whether it is willing or able to promote competition and protect consumers,\" wrote Cicilline. \"If the commission does conclude that Facebook has violated the consent order, how it fixes this problem through a legal remedy will be a test of its effectiveness.\"</p><p>Cicilline also said Facebook's recent announcement of its plan to merge the messaging infrastructure of WhatsApp Inc., Instagram Inc. and Facebook Messenger furthered the company's monopoly power. However, Makan Delrahim, assistant attorney general for the antitrust division at the U.S. Department of Justice, said in January that the integration would not automatically trigger a formal antitrust review, but he did acknowledge it could get the attention of antitrust officials.</p><p>The FTC is already investigating Facebook for possibly violating a 2011 consent order on privacy practices. Facebook is reportedly facing a multibillion-dollar fine from the agency.</p><p>Cicilline is not alone in Congress calling for more regulatory scrutiny of the company.</p><p>Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., said on March 19 that Facebook was an \"extremely creepy company,\" and that he is hopeful he will see FTC enforcement activity against Facebook soon.</p><p>The comments from the two lawmakers come on the heels of a recent proposal from Sen.
